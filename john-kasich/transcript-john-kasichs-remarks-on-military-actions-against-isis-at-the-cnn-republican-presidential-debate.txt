I called for boots on the ground many months ago in a coalition with our friends who share our interests. 
You know, you win a battle with the military and when we go somewhere we need to be mobile and lethal and we need to take care of business and we need to come home.

You wonder why young people and educated people and rich people, school people have tried to join ISIS? 
Western civilization &#8211; all of us &#8211; need to wake up to the fact that those murderers and rapists need to be called out.  
And in Western civilization we need to make it clear that our faith in the Jewish and Christian principles force us to live a life bigger than ourselves to be sinners and justice so that we can battle the radicals, call them out for what they are, and make sure that all of our people feel fulfilled in living in Western civilizationâ€¦ [overlapping audio]
