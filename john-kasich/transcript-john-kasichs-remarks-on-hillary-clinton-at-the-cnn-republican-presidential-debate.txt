Well, look, people still have to get to know me so I want to spend my time talking about my experience reforming welfare, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, providing economic growth when I was in Washington, turning Ohio around &#8211; $8 billion in the hole, $2 billion surplus &#8211; up over 300,000 jobs, big tax cuts, strengthening our credit. All those things matter. 
But as a young man in my first election in 1978, I defeated an incumbent Democrat. I defeated an incumbent Democrat in 1982 running on the Reagan program. I was the only Republican in America to defeat an incumbent Democrat that year. 
And then when I won election for governor, I was the first Republican to defeat an incumbent in 36 years and the first person to have never run statewide, out of politics for 10 years to beat an incumbent; that hadn’t happened for 96 years. 
So we’ll get to the point where we’ll talk about Hillary Clinton or whoever the nominee is &#8211; their record. 
But right now, I want to give people a sense of hope, a sense of purpose, a sense of unity, a sense that we can do it. 
So you at the end of the day, I’m going to continue to talk about my record because do you ever notice when people run for office, they make a lot of promises, they don’t keep them. 
I don’t intend to do that and I’m going to be out there pushing it out. 
Don’t worry about me and Hillary. That’ll all work out. And I’m from Ohio. She will not beat me there. I can promise you that.
