Well, I agree that we should defund Planned Parenthood. I don’t know many people in America that don’t think that we should. 
And in my state, we’re trying to figure out how to get it done because we’re threatened with the federal government taking over our Medicaid money away. 
I think there’s a way to get this done by giving governors the ability to be able to act to defund Planned Parenthood. 
But when it comes to closing down the federal government, you’ve got to be very careful about that. When we shut the government down, if we have a chance of success and it’s a great principle, yes. 
The President of the United States is not going to sign this. 
And all we’re going to do is shut the government down and then we’re going to open it up and the American people are going to shake their heads and say “What’s the story with these Republicans?”
So I think there is a way to get to cutting off the funding for Planned Parenthood. 
I was in the Congress for 18 years, balanced the budget, cut taxes, got it done, changed welfare, went around the President to get welfare reform done. 
There are ways to do it without having to shut the government down but I’m sympathetic to the fact that we don’t want this organization to get funding and the money ought to be reprogrammed for family planning in other organizations that don’t support this tactic. 
But I would not be for shutting the government down because I don’t think it’s going to work out.
