Partial transcript of remarks by Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) on same-sex marriage at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
John Kasich:
And guess what? I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. 
Because somebody doesn’t think the way I do doesn’t mean that I can’t care about them or I can’t love them. 
So if one of my daughters happen to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? That’s what we’re taught when we have strong faith. 
So, issues like that are planted to divide us. 
I think the simple fact of the matter is &#8211; and this is where I would agree with Jeb and I’ve been saying it all along &#8211; we need to give everybody a chance, treat everybody with respect, and let them share in this great American dream that we have…
So, look, I’m going to love my daughters. I’m going to love them no matter what they do. 
Because you know what? God gives me unconditional love. I’m going to give it to my family and my friends and the people around me.
