Partial transcript of remarks by Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) on God at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
John Kasich:
I do believe in miracles. 
You know, I’ve had a lot of elections. But my elections are not really about campaigns. 
I tell my people that these are about a movement and a movement to do what? To restore common sense. A movement to do things like provide economic growth. And a movement not to let anybody be behind. 
You know, today, the country’s divided. You asked a question about the police and the difficulty in communities. 
We’ve got to unite our country again because we’re stronger when we are united and we are weaker when we are divided. And we’ve got to listen to other people’s voices, respect them. 
But keep in mind &#8211; I believe, I believe in terms of the things that I’ve read in my lifetime, the Lord’s not picking us but because of how we respect human rights, because that we are a good force in the world, he wants America to be strong, he wants America to succeed, and he wants America to lead. 
And nothing’s more important to me than my family, my faith, and my friends.
