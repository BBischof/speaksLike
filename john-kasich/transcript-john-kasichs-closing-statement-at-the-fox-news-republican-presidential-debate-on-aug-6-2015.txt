Partial transcript of closing remarks by Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
You know, tonight we hear about what people want to do. I want to tell you what I&#8217;ve done. 
I was a member of the Armed Services Committee for 18 years. I spent a big chunk of my life studying national security issues and our role in the world. 
Number two, I was the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, and one of the chief architects the last time we balanced the budget. And it was the first time we&#8217;ve done it since man walked on the moon. We had a $5 trillion surplus and we cut taxes. 
I spent 10 years in the private sector actually learning how business works. 
And now I&#8217;m the governor of Ohio and I inherited a state that was on the brink of dying and we&#8217;ve turned it all around with jobs and balanced budgets and rising credits and tax cuts, and the state is unified and people have hope again in Ohio.
