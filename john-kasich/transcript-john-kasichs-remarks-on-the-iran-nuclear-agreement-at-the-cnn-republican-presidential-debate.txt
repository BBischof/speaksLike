First of all, I think it’s a bad agreement. I would’ve never done it. 
But you know, a lot of our problems in the world today is that we don’t have the relationship with our allies. 
If we want to go everywhere alone, we will not have the strength as if we can rebuild our relationships with our allies. 
Now, this agreement &#8211; we don’t know what’s going to happen in 18 months. 
I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years. I’ve seen lots of issues in foreign affairs and in terms of global politics, you have to be steady. 
Now here’s the &#8211; if they cheat, we slap the sanctions back on. If they help Hamas and Hezbollah, we slap the sanctions back on. 
And if we find out that they may be developing a nuclear weapon then the military option is on the table. 
We are stronger when we work with the western civilization, our friends in Europe, and just doing it on our own I don’t think is the right policy. 
Let me suggest to you we believe we operate better in the world when our allies work with us. 
President Bush did it in the Gulf War. We work better when we are unified. 
Secondly, nobody’s trusting Iran. They violate the deal, we put on the sanctions. We have the high moral ground to talk to our allies in Europe, to get them to go with us. If they don’t go with us, we slap the sanctions on anyway. 
If they fund these radical groups that threaten Israel and all the west, then we should rip up the deal and put the sanctions back on. 
…If we think they’re getting close to developing a nuclear weapon and we get that information, you’d better believe that I would do everything in my power as the commander in chief to stop them having a nuclear weapon. 
We can have it and we can have our allies and we can be strong as a country and we can project across this globe with unity, not just doing it alone. That is not what gets us where we want to get as a nation.
