&#8230;I saw something on one of the news stations last week. I saw the President speaking and he said something to this effect: The world respect America more because of my administration. 
And I came to the conclusion that day that everything that we have worried about is true. He really is living in his own world. 
Look at what&#8217;s happening around the world right now. When you think about the world that Barack Obama inherited when he came into the White House and the world that he&#8217;ll be leaving the next President, it is startling how much damage can be done to America&#8217;s reputation in seven short years. 
Look at what&#8217;s happening around the world. 
In Western Europe, they live in active of terrorist attacks from extremist Islamists. 
In Eastern Europe for the first time in 70 years after the explosion of spending that we did there and lives that we gave up there to have a free and united Europe, we have Russian soldiers marching in Eastern Europe for the first time in 70 years. 
And across the Middle East, Iraq is on fire, Libya is on fire, Syria is on fire, Jordan is being invaded for the third wave of war time refugees, Egypt is under marshal law. 
And Iran, with this President&#8217;s permission, is steaming towards becoming a nuclear power and a dominant force in that region. 
And in China, we watched the Chinese building artificial islands in the South China Sea and we have a President who says he doesn&#8217;t want us to sail our ships within 12 miles of those islands nor fly American plans over head because he does not want to get into a dispute with the Chinese. 
The dispute is being caused by the Chinese, not by those who want to navigate the free waters of the world. 
And you look at all these circumstances and you realize what an awful bill of goods this President sold the American people seven years ago. 
He tried to make us believe that America was the cause of violence in the world, that if we just pulled back from Iraq and Afghanistan and said nice things and gave nice speeches that somehow the world will be a safer, more peaceful place. 
Well, the exact opposite&#8217;s happened, and now we have fires all over the world and the reason those fires have occurred everybody is the lack of American leadership and the lack of American strength and this country needs to lead the world again so that it&#8217;s safe for liberty and prosperity for all of the people in the world and for the people that live here in the United States. 
This President has diminished our military both through actions that have hurt their morale like the awful scandal at the Veterans Administration where veterans who have come home have been denied the health care that they&#8217;ve been promised. 
That is a national disgrace. This President has refused to fix it in a way that honors the service of our veterans. 
And then in practical ways. We have 100,000 fewer soldiers &#8211; active duty soldiers in our Army. We&#8217;re headed towards a 260 ship Navy &#8211; the smallest it&#8217;s been in our lifetimes. 
And we&#8217;re headed towards a 50% reduction in the hardware in the Air Force.
Listen everybody, if I know these numbers, so does Vladimir Putin, so does the mullahs in Iran. 
And their conduct around the world being more aggressive and less respectful is I believe a direct result of this President&#8217;s weakness and the weakness that he&#8217;s put on our military. 
&#8230;
We need to make our military strong because what the public has always understood is that strength brings peace; it doesn&#8217;t cause war. Weakness causes war. 
And speaking of weakness, let me say this: Of all the people who may come before you, who are considering entering the race for President, I&#8217;m the only one who&#8217;s had the responsibility of having to prosecute and investigate terrorist conduct. 
I was appointed United States Attorney for New Jersey by President George W. Bush on Sept. 10, 2001. 
The next day my wife went to work two blocks away from the World Trade Center, and I was on the phone with her when the second plane hit the second building. She was assuring me that everything was fine, that she was okay. 
The phone went out. She was evacuated, and for 5.5 hours I did not hear from her. I could tell you those were the longest 5.5 hours of my life with our three young children wanting to know if mom was okay. 
Well, thank God she was okay. 
But we lost one of our dear friends in our parish in our town that day in the World Trade Center. And our oldest son, his best friend lost his father. 
We&#8217;ve watched that young man for the last 13 years and his siblings put up with the emptiness that can never be filled &#8211; the place of a parent that was lost much too young. 
You see, these things are not hypothetical to me. I live in a state that lost the second most people on Sept. 11th, only less than the state of New York. 
And I went to the funerals of the people that we knew who were killed that day. 
And what the United States Congress has done in the last few weeks through their changing of the PATRIOT Act, I will tell you today, has made America weaker and more vulnerable. 
There is no excuse for taking legitimate tools away from our intelligence community in what is a dangerous and dirty world. 
And the fact is that if civil liberties are your concern, there are many ways for us to protect those civil liberties and we have. I could tell you. I was a U.S. Attorney who reviewed PATRIOT Act applications, who reviewed applications of the FISA court. 
And who brought the first terrorism case post-9/11 of an Indian-born British citizen who was trying to sell shoulder fired missiles to what he believed to be many terrorist groups to shoot commercial airliners out of the sky at Newark Airport. We prosecuted him with the use of the PATRIOT Act. We convicted him, and he got sentenced to over 50 years in prison and since he was in his early 60s, I hope that we don&#8217;t have to worry about him again. 
But here&#8217;s the fact, everybody, those tools allow us to do what President Bush instructed us to do after 9/11 which is to never let this happen again. 
If Congress is worried about civil liberties as they should be, have aggressive congressional oversight. If they&#8217;re worried about people going outside of the line, then prosecute those people who go outside the line. 
But do not put the men and women of our intelligence community in harm&#8217;s way and do not make America weaker and more vulnerable when Al Qaeda and ISIS are plotting and planning everyday to attack and kill us just because we&#8217;re Americans. 
These type of actions, I am telling you from experience, are short-sighted. 
And these same people who give these long speeches up on Capitol Hill if God forbid there&#8217;s another attack on this country will be the first ones to haul the CIA Director, the FBI Director up to Capitol Hill, put them under oath and excorciate them for not connecting the dots and preventing the attack without for a moment understanding the hypocrisy that underlies that questioning because they were the ones who made the job harder for these people to do. 
This is a fight we need to have everybody, and this is a fight we better open our eyes to. 
This is not about politics. This is about life and death for our country, and I stand with keeping America safe and making America strong and not giving political speeches on the floor of the Senate to raise money for a presidential campaign. 
That&#8217;s where I stand. 
But to do these things, to project authority around the world in a way that helps make people free and safe, to be able to strengthen our intelligence community, to strengthen our military, we need to invest in that. 
The shame of what is going on in this country right now is that in the current federal budget 71% of all they spend is on interest on the debt and entitlement programs. 
Now, listen everybody, those programs are important but they&#8217;re heading towards insolvency. We all know this. You know this in your heart. You know it to be true. 
Yet, we don&#8217;t want to talk about it because we&#8217;re all dominated by political consultants who tell us, &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk about entitlement, for goodness sake&#8217;s. It&#8217;s the third rail of American politics. Don&#8217;t even touch it.&#8221;
Well, I&#8217;m not going to touch it everybody. I&#8217;m going to hug it. [Laughter] Because if we don&#8217;t have this conversation, we are selling our country short. Worse yet, we are resigning our children to a lesser life. 
&#8230;
Social Security is a promise. It is a promise that is rooted in this idea that no one in America who has worked hard should grow old in poverty. That is a good idea and the right idea. 
But now, we&#8217;re to the point where the choices are few because of the lack of action by our leaders.
So yes, I&#8217;ve said we should raise the retirement age two years over the next 25 years. Think about that. A two-year increase in 25 years. I&#8217;ll be 77 when it becomes fully effective. 
Will the world really stop spinning on its axis for that? 
Or to say to someone who makes over $200,000 a year in retirement income &#8211; retirement income &#8211; that maybe you don&#8217;t need to get your Social Security check. 
That means you&#8217;ve got $4 million or $5 million saved if you&#8217;re getting $200,000 of retirement income. Do you really need your Social Security check then? Or is it better to leave the money for the person who really needs it, who&#8217;s trying to figure out whether to pay the rent or to buy food or pay the heating bill or go to the doctor? 
You see, these programs, if we don&#8217;t do this, you only have two other choices, everybody. Either insolvency, which is creeping up on us over the next 7 or 8 years. Or a massive tax increase on all the American people, which will be damaging to our economy and hurtful to working families today. 
You see, our opponents on the Democratic side said they don&#8217;t touch Social Security because they&#8217;re for the working person. 
Baloney. They don&#8217;t touch Social Security because they polled it and they don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s popular.
Well, here&#8217;s what I think. Leaders are not supposed to follow polls. Leaders are supposed to change polls and lead by telling people what needs to be done. 
I have no idea how a massive payroll tax increase on all the American people are good for our middle class working families. 
Taking more money out of their pockets is not what they need in an economy that Barack Obama has turned into a part-time employment economy. That&#8217;s what he&#8217;s done. 
Since 2007, 4 million more people in America are working at part-time jobs and 3.2 million fewer people are working at full-time jobs. That&#8217;s the economy this President has bequeathed to this country. 
And now the idea that others want to roll other massive tax increases on top of that just make no sense to me. 
That&#8217;s why we need to discuss entitlement reform. That&#8217;s why we need to reform Medicare as well. Let&#8217;s increase eligibility two years and phase it in over the next 25. 
And if you make over $200,000 a year in retirement income, let&#8217;s not subsidize your Medicare premium 75% as we do now. Let&#8217;s subsidize them 10%. 
Hey, if you have money to pay it, you&#8217;re blessed. You&#8217;ve worked hard and this country&#8217;s given you the opportunity to work hard, have a great idea and have that success. 
No place else in the world does that happen. Let us make sure we understand that. What the real stakes are. 
Don&#8217;t listen to the people who come behind this podium and say as one of my fellow former governors said &#8220;You can&#8217;t touch Social Security. This is a sacred trust. If the government lies and steals from you, what do we have left?&#8221;
What I&#8217;d say to him is &#8220;Governor, the lying and stealing has already occurred.&#8221; 
Remember Al Gore in 2006? It was a lockbox. A lockbox we&#8217;re putting this money in. 
Let me tell you what&#8217;s in the lockbox, everybody. A stack of IOUs is what&#8217;s in the lockbox. 
The lying and stealing has already happened. 
&#8230;
So now the question is not to prevent the lying and stealing. the horse is already out of the barn. 
Now it&#8217;s how do we get the horse back in the barn. 
And you all know, it&#8217;s a lot easier for the horse to run out of the barn than it is to get it back in. It didn&#8217;t want to go in the barn; that&#8217;s why it ran out in the first place. 
&#8216;Cause it&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s hard to do these things. 
And we need to though. 
And that&#8217;s why the first speech I&#8217;ve given in this national conversation is on entitlement reform not because it was strong politics but because it was strong leadership, and that&#8217;s what we need in this country again is people who are willing to tell us the truth whether they think we&#8217;re going to like it the first time we hear it or not. 
&#8230;I got re-elected in New Jersey with 61% of the vote. 
Let me tell you, the Democrats in New Jersey said I&#8217;d never get elected the first time when John Corzine outspent me 3 to 1 in a state that hasn&#8217;t elected a Republican to the United States Senate in 42 years. It is the longest streak of any state in the country. This is as blue a state as there is in America. 
Getting outspent 3 to 1, we beat a Democratic incumbent because people sensed that we were strong enough to tell them the truth and then to follow through on it. 
And in the years since, we&#8217;ve cut business taxes over $2 billion. We&#8217;ve balanced budgets 6 years in a row. We&#8217;ve capped property taxes. 
We reformed the oldest teacher tenure law in America so that now teachers that get a failing grade can get fired and not have a job for life in front of our children&#8217;s classrooms. 
And we reformed the pensions and benefits system that still needs more work but is better than it was when I got there and has now withstood a fight all the way to the New Jersey Supreme Court who have now upheld those reforms that says &#8220;Yes, workers need to pay more into their pension and cannot get cost of living adjustments anymore on the backs of hardworking taxpayers in my state.&#8221; 
Those things were all accomplished by the way with a Democratic legislature. Not even close, everybody, 24-16 in the Senate, 48-32 in the lower house. 
These guys do not wake up every morning and say, &#8220;How can we make Chris Christie happy today?&#8221; [Laughter]
Believe me. But it does not stop me from doing the things that I think are right and does not stop me from compromising to be able to get things done. 
You need to do both. 
So when they send me Planned Parenthood funding year after year after year and I&#8217;m the first governor to ever veto Planned Parenthood funding out of the budget, there is no room for compromise there. 
But when you have a pensions and benefits proposal that the President of the Senate &#8211; a Democrat &#8211; is willing to sponsor, if you make a few changes, well then yes, you need to make those changes and you need to compromise. 
Compromise is not a dirty word. It&#8217;s compromising our principles that is wrong. 
But our government is set up to force compromise. 
Listen, the people of New Jersey have now twice elected a conservative Republican governor and a liberal Democratic legislature. They&#8217;re like the 13-year-olds in the basement doing a science experiment. They say let&#8217;s mix these two things together and see what happens. 
But what&#8217;s happened is that in a state where in the the 8 years before I became governor we had zero net private sector job growth. For 8 years, zero net private sector jobs. In the 5.5 years since I&#8217;ve been governor, we have created now nearly 200,000 new private sector jobs in New Jersey. 
We took an economic basket case and put it on the road to recovery and those 200,000 families who are now working who were not working when I became governor know the power of our ideas and how they work for our state and for our country. That&#8217;s what we need to fight for &#8211; putting people back to work. 
&#8230;
But when you&#8217;re pro-life, you need to be pro-life for the whole life. 
The easiest time in my view to be pro-life is when that child is in the womb. They haven&#8217;t done anything yet to disappoint us. [Laughter]
They haven&#8217;t made any bad choices yet. 
Because it&#8217;s a lot harder to be pro-life when they&#8217;re drug addicted on the floor of a jail cell. That is a gift from God as well. 
That life is a gift from God and that&#8217;s why in New Jersey we say for first time non-violent drug offenders we&#8217;re no longer sending those people to prison. We&#8217;re sending them to mandatory in-patient drug treatment because we need to save lives in this country not dispose of them because every one of those lives is a gift from God and deserves a chance at redemption. 
Life is precious, and we learned that again in South Carolina. 
The idea that anyone &#8211; that any human being &#8211; would walk into a church and sit there for an hour and pray with people that he intended to murder is depraved. It&#8217;s unthinkable. We can&#8217;t put our minds around conduct like that, can we? 
And so I want to conclude with this today. All the issues that I just talked about and lots of others that I didn&#8217;t mention are really important to the future of our country. 
But there&#8217;s nothing more important today than to taking as many moments as you can to pray for the families of those victims. Good decent people who cared about their church, who loved God and their families, who worked for their communities, who served in public life, who were cut down by someone who is depraved and disturbed and seemingly has now confessed to the crime. 
In fact, he even said he spared one of his victims and told her, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to kill you because I want you to be alive to tell people what happened here.&#8221; 
This type of conduct is something that only our display of our love and good faith that&#8217;s in our heart can change. 
Laws can&#8217;t change this. Only the good will and a love of the American people can let those folks know that that act was unacceptable, disgraceful. We need to do more to show that we love each other. 
Open our chest, open our hearts and show love to each other. That&#8217;s what leadership is about too, everybody. 
So I pray for those families today, and I suspect you will too. 
And if we can have the power of our prayers and the power of our conduct be an example to those who have hate in their hearts, then we&#8217;re doing what we need to do to make our community, our states, and our country a better place. 
I know that this audience believes that, and I know it&#8217;s the way you live your lives. 
So let us use the power that we derive from that in a way that will help to heal the wounds of these families. 
It&#8217;s moments like this when America comes together and shows the rest of the world what a great country we really are. And I know you&#8217;ll be part of that, and you can count on the fact that I will be too&#8230;
