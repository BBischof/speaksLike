I know Ben [Carson] doesn’t think that about me. I’m sure he was talking about one of the other guys, not me. [Laughter]
And as far as being outsiders is concerned…let me tell you this…I’m a Republican in New Jersey. I wake up every morning as an outsider. I wake up every morning with a Democratic legislature who’s trying to beat my head in and fight me because I’m trying to bring conservative change to a state that needed it desperately. 
And so everyone here can talk about their credentials but the bottom line is every morning I get up, I’ve vetoed 400 bills from a crazy liberal Democratic legislature. Not one of them has been over-written. I’ve vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history, according to Americans for Tax Reform. 
What folks want in this country is somebody to go down there and get the job done. And that’s exactly what I’ll do. 
So I know this much. That what the American people want to hire right now is somebody who believes in them and believes that they are the ones who can fix our country. 
I will be the vessel through which they can fix this country. 
But it’s not about me. It’s about all of you and getting this government off your back and out of your way and letting you succeed. 
So I know that Ben wasn’t talking about me. Look, he’s smiling at me right now. I know Ben didn’t mean it about me. These other guys I’m sure.
