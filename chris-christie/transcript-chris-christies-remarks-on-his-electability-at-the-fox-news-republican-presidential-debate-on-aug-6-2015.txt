Question:
So why should voters believe that your management of the country’s finances would be any different?  
Gov. Chris Christie (R-New Jersey):
The fact is in the eight years before I became governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times.
In the eight years before I became governor, spending was increased 56%. 
And in the eight years before I became governor, there was zero net private sector job growth in New Jersey. Zero for eight years. 
So what did we do? We came in. We balanced an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget. 
We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases. In fact, we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor. 
We cut business taxes $2.3 billion and we cut regulation by one-third of what my predecessor put in place. 
And what’s happened since? 192,000 new private sector jobs in the 5.5 years I’ve been governor. 
We have a lot of work to do in New Jersey, but I am darn proud of how we brought our state back.
