I don’t think Sen. Rubio is a skeptic of climate change. I think what Sen. Rubio said I agree with.
That in fact we don’t need this massive government intervention to deal with the problem.
Look at what we’ve done in New Jersey. We’ve already reached our cleaner goals for 2020, and when I was governor, I pulled out of the regional cap and trade deal &#8211; the only state in the northeast that did that, and we still reached our goals.
Why? Because 53% of our electricity comes from nuclear. We use natural gas. We use solar power. We’re the third highest using solar power state. You know why? Because we made all of those things economically feasible.
I agree with Marco. We shouldn’t be destroying our economy in order to chase some wild left wing idea that somehow us by ourselves is going to fix the climate.
We can contribute to that and be economically sound. We’ve proven that we could do that in New Jersey.
Nuclear needs to back on the table in a significant way in this country if we want to go after this problem.
Listen, everybody makes a mistake every once in a while even George Shultz. And if that’s truly a representation of what he believes we should be doing, then with all due respect to the former Secretary of State, I disagree with him.
