I was named U.S. Attorney by President Bush on Sept. 10, 2001. And that next day, my wife Mary Pat did what she did everyday &#8211; she traveled through the World Trade Center and went to her office two blocks from the World Trade Center. 
And after those planes hit, for 5.5 hours after that I couldn’t reach her, didn’t know if she was dead or alive. We had three children at the time &#8211; 8, 5, and 1. 
And I had to confront what so many others in my region had to confront the idea that I might become a single parent, the idea that my life and my children’s life might be changed forever. 
We lost friends that day. We went to the funerals. 
And I will tell you that what those people wanted and what they deserved was for an America to answer back against what had been done to them. 
And I support what President Bush did at that time, going into Afghanistan, hunting Al Qaeda and its leaders, getting its sanctuary out of place, and making it as difficult to around the world for them to move people and money.
And then he went to prosecutors like us and he said “Never again. Don’t prosecute these people after the crime’s committed; intervene before the crime happens.” 
I absolutely believe that what the President did at the time was right and I am proud to have been one of the people on this stage that was part of making sure that what Gov. Bush said before was the truth. America was safe for those seven years and Barack Obama has taken that safety away from us.
