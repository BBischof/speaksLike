Partial transcript of closing remarks by Gov. Chris Christie (R-New Jersey) at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
&#8230;Listen, I was born into a middle class family in New Jersey. 
My dad came home from serving in the Army after having lost his father, worked in the Breyer&#8217;s ice cream in Newark, New Jersey, and was the first person to graudate from college &#8211; put himself through college at night. 
My mom was a secretary. 
I was appointed United States Attorney on Sept. 10, 2001. I spent the next seven years of my career fighting terrorists and putting terrorists in jail. 
I&#8217;m a conservative pro-life governor in a state where it&#8217;s really tough to be both, in a state like New Jersey with lots of Democrats. But still, we cut taxes, we balanced budgets, we fought the teachers&#8217; union. 
This President has had weak leadership, which has led to bad choices. 
We got to stop worrying about being loved and start worrying about being respected and that&#8217;s exactly how I&#8217;ll lead our country.
