Partial transcript of remarks by Gov. Chris Christie (R-New Jersey) on foreign aid at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question on foreign aid: 
Chris Christie:
I agree with what Dr. Carson said earlier. The first thing we need to do to make America stronger is to strengthen our military. 
And I’ve put out a really specific plan &#8211; no less than 500,000 active duty soldiers in the Army, no less than 185,000 active duty Marines in the Marine Corps. Bring us to a 350 ship Navy again and modernize the Ohio class of submarines. And bring our Air Force back to 2,600 aircraft that are ready to go. 
Those are the kinds of things that are going to send a clear message around the world. 
Those are the things that we need to start working on immediately to make our country stronger and make it better. 
Those are the things that we need to be able to be doing. 
And as we move towards dealing with foreign aid, I don’t disagree with Sen. Paul’s position that we shouldn’t be funding our enemies. 
But I absolutely believe that Israel is a priority to be able to fund and keep them strong and safe after eight years of this administration.
