Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley’s remarks on Syrian refugees at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
What I would say is this &#8211; look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept and if this humanitarian crisis increases we should accept more. 
…There are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees. I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian community and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months. There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through. 
We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers. 
What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition and tells the families “You better get out now.” The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering &#8211; these are not the perpetrators. 
We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty and we need to act like the great country we are according to our values.
