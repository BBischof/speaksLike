Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley’s remarks on Libya at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
In this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region. 
And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence. We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up. That’s what Chris Stevens was trying to do but without the tools, without the support that was needed to do that. 
And now what we have is a whole stretch right now of the coast of Libya &#8211; 100 miles, 150 miles &#8211; that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL. They go back and forth between Syria and this region. 
We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
