Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley’s remarks on the role of the First Lady at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
[Question on whether Katie O’Malley would have to give up her position as a district court judge if she becomes First Lady]
Well, that’ll be totally up to her. 
I mean, Katie is never been a person who let her husband’s professional choices get in the way of following her dreams. And I think she got that from her mother.
And I readily admit she’s a far more accomplished lawyer than I was ever able to become before I took my detour. She is a district court judge in Maryland. She puts in a full day there. 
We’ve raised four terrific kids and yet when she was First Lady of the state, not only would she go to work everyday and sit there through a lot of sad and gut wrenching cases, but then she’d put in additional time being an advocate against domestic violence. Maryland made great strides on that because of her advocacy and her understanding of how the court process works. She was an advocate against bullying and implementing anti-bullying things. 
So, Katie O’Malley will do whatever Katie O’Malley wants to do regardless of her husband’s success in getting elected president.
