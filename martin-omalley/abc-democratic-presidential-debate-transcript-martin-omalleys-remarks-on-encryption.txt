Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley’s remarks on encryption at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
I believe that we should never give up our privacy, never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security. 
We need to figure this out together. We need a collaborative approach. We need new leadership. 
The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure things out. 
The federal government should have to get warrants. That’s not some sort of passe antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms. 
But at the same time with new technologies, I believe that the people creating these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out true to our American principles and values. 
My friend…who’s a doctor in Maryland &#8211; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves. He was putting his 10 and 12 year old boys to bed the other night and he is a proud American Muslim. And one of his little boys said to him, “Dad, what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?” 
These are very, very real issues. This is a clear and present danger in our politics within. 
We need to speak to what unites us as a people &#8211; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of worship, and we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security, especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
