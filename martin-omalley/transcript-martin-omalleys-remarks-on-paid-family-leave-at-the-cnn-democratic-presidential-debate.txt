In our state, we actually expanded family leave, and I have to agree with Secretary Clinton and Sen. Sanders. 
Look, the genius in our nation is that we find ways in every generation to include more of our people more fully in the economic life of our country and we need to do that for our families, especially so that women arenâ€™t penalized and having to drop out of the workforce. 
My wife, Katie, is here with our four kids. And man, that was a juggle when we had little kids and keeping jobs and moving forward. 
We would be a stronger nation economically if we had paid family leave.
