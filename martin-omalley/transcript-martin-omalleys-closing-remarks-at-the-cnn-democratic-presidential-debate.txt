I am very, very grateful to have been able to be on this stage with this distinguished group of candidates tonight. 
And what you heard tonight…was a very, very different debate than from the sort of debate from the two presidential Republican debates. 
On this stage, you didn’t hear anyone denigrate women. You didn’t hear anyone make racists comments about new American immigrants. You didn’t hear anyone speak ill of another American because of their religious belief. 
What you heard instead on this stage tonight was an honest search for the answers that will move our country forward, to move us to 100% clean electric energy grid by 2050, to take the actions that we have always taken as Americans so that we can actually attack injustice in our country, employ more of our people, rebuild our cities and towns, educate our children at higher and better levels, and include more of our people in the economic, social, and political life of our country. 
I truly believe that we are standing on the threshold of a new era of American progress. 
And lest you become discouraged about our gridlock in Congress, talk to our young people under 30 because you’ll never find among them people who want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples. That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place and we need to speak to the goodness within our country.
