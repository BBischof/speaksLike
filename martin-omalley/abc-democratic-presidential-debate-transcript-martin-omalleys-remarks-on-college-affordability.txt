Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley’s remarks on college affordability at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
This one falls on the category of I have actually done this. 
As a governor, we actually made the greater investments so that we can go four years in a row without a penny’s increase to college tuition. 
My plan actually goes further than Sen. Sanders’s because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and fees. 
So as a nation, we need to increase what we invest in Pell Grants. 
Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance. But states need to do more as well and I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well. 
I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan. 
I’m joined tonight by my two daughters &#8211; Tara and Grace. My oldest daughter is a teacher. Their mother is here as well. We were proud of them on graduation day, weren’t we, Katie? And we’re going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives. I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and we’re not the only ones. 
There are families all across America who aren’t able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan. 
I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to. 
Because my dad went to college after coming back from World War II on the GI Bill but today we’re the only nation on the planet that’s saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills. That’s a drag on the economy. It’s one of the key investments we need to make.  
I was flattered Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers. 
And in our party unlike the Republican Party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
