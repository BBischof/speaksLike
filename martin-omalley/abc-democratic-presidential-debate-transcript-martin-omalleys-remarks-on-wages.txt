Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley’s remarks on wages at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
Look, these are the things that we did in my own state through the recession. 
We actually passed a living wage. We raised the minimum wage. We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation our minority and women participation goals. 
Because we understood the way you re-invigorate and make fair market American capitalism work is to make the choices and investments that include more people more fully in the economic success of your state. 
All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African-American families. How? By actually doing more for education. We increased education funding by 37%. 
We were the only state in America that went four year’s in a row without a penny’s increase to college tuition. 
We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100% clean electric energy future. We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry. And we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices. 
…The conclusion of all of those things is this: They weren’t hopes, they weren’t dreams, they weren’t amorphous goals out there. We actually took actions to these things. 
And as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families. 
Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth unemployment. 
And I’m the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America’s cities so we can employ more people in the hearts of great American cities and get them back to work.
