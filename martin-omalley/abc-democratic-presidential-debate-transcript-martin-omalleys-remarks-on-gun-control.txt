Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley’s remarks on gun control at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
…I’m the only person on this stage who has actually passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons…
And look, there are profound differences in this race on this issue. 
Sen. Sanders voted against the Brady Bill. Sen. Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers. And Sen. Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue. 
Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don’t need federal standards. 
Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls. We need more principle. 
When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up. We need comprehensive gun safety legislation…[overlapping audio]

And at least if we enact these in a prospective way, we can address some major vulnerability in our country. ISIL videos &#8211; ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show and it’s because of the flip flopping political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last 40 years.

Martin O’Malley: 
Bernie Sanders: 
In 1988, just to set the record straight, governor, I ran for the U.S. House. We have one House member from Vermont. Three candidates in the race. One candidate…said, “You know what? I don’t think it’s a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly.” Gun people said “There are three candidates in the race. You vote for one of the others but not Bernie Sanders.” I lost that election by 3% quite likely for that reason. 
So please do not explain to me coming from a state where Democratic governors and Republican governors have supported virtually no gun control…Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loophole and now in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
