Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley’s remarks on gathering human intelligence on ISIS at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
Well, we have invested nowhere near where we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground, and what I’m talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I’m also talking about the diplomatic intelligence. 
I mean, we’ve seen time and time again especially in this very troubled region of nation state failures and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward. 
So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms but we do our military a disservice when we don’t great dial up the investment that we’re waking in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly the role of sustainable development in all of this. 
As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member. We have to act in a much more whole of government approach as Gen. Dempsey said.
…And I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues &#8211; look, this is a genocidal threat. They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly because of our blunders to be created there in the areas of Syria and Iraq. 
And as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats. 
…This will not be the last region where nation-states fail and you see a little bit of this emerging in the African-Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia. We need to pay attention here in Central America as well. 
So this is the new type of threats that we’re facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
