Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley’s remarks on regime change in Syria at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL. That is the clear and present danger. 
And I believe we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution…There should be a political process but we shouldn’t be the ones declaring that Assad must go. 
Where did it ever say in the Constitution? Where is it written that it’s the job of the United States of America or its Secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go? 
Hillary Clinton: 
The reason we are in the mess we’re in that ISIS has the territory it has is because of Assad…
We advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still Secretary of State because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now…
We look at these complex problems &#8211; I wish it could be either or. I wish we could say “Yes, let’s go destroy ISIS…Let Assad continue to destroy Syria which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.” 
No, we now finally are where we need to be…and a commitment to go after ISIS, which is danger to us as well as to the region and we finally have a U.N. Security Council resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria. 
If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader…And we have to lead if we’re going to be successful. 
Bernie Sanders: 
The United States at the same time cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS. ISIS now is the…[inaudible]…Assad &#8211; later, let’s have a democratic Syria. But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
