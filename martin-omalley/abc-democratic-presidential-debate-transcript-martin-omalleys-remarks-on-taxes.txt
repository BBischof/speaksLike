Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley’s remarks on taxes at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
No, I’ve never made a promise like that but unlike either of these two fine people I’ve actually balanced the budget every single year. 
I was one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating. By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started. 
But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest earning people to pay another 14%. 
David, look, this is the big &#8211; I agree…have paid family leave and I agree with Sen. Sanders on that. And just like Social Security &#8211; and unlike the Republicans, I think we should expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits. 
But look, there’s one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us &#8211; those earning more than $1 million &#8211; are able to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains. 
If we were raise the marginal rate to 45% [to people earning more than $1 million]… and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you can generate $800 billion over 10 years, and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again. 
So the things that I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up. That’s the issue that we need to tackle as Americans and we can do it and we know how.
