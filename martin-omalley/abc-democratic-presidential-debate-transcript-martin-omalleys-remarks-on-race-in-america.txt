Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley’s remarks on race in America at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
…There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America. 
When I ran in 1999…for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America. 
But we came together. I brought people together over some very deep racial divides and we were able to put our cities on a path to the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next 10 years. 
As governor, we continued to work together. We reduced violent crime to 30 year lows. But get this &#8211; we also reduced incarceration rates to 20 year lows. 
So it is possible actually to find the things that actually work that we did &#8211; increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half. 
And it’s also possible to improve how we police our police. 
Look, there wasn’t a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn’t asked whether I was delivering on the promise that I made to the police. We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force. In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force. 
As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable. Just as we require every department at county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force. 
There’s so much work that can be done. So much we’ve learned to do better. We need to do it now as a nation. This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
