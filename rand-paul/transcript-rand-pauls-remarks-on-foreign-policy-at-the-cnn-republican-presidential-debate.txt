I think this goes back to essentially what we’ve been saying for the last two or three questions. 
Carly Fiorina also said we’re not going to talk to Putin. 
Well, think of if Reagan had said that over the Cold War. We continued to talk to the Russians throughout the Cold War, which is much more significant than where we are now. 
Should we continue to talk with Iran? Yes. 
Should we cut up the agreement immediately? That’s absurd. Wouldn’t you want to know if they’ve complied? 
Now, I’m going to vote against the agreement because I don’t think there’s significant leverage. 
But it doesn’t mean that I would immediately not look at the agreement and cut it up without looking to see whether Iran has complied. 
The same goes with China. I don’t think we need to be rash. I don’t think we need to be reckless. And I think we need to leave lines of communications open. 
Often we talk about whether we should be engaged in the world; we’re disengaged in the world. 
And I think this is an example of some who want to isolate us actually and not be engaged. 
We do need to be engaged with Russia. It doesn’t mean we give them a free pass or China a free pass. 
But to be engaged means to continue to talk. We did throughout the Cold War. 
It’d be a big mistake not to do it.
