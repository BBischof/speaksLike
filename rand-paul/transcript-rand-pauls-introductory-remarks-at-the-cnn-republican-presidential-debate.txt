Good evening everyone. I’m an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky. 
My wife Kelley and I have been married for nearly 25 years. 
And I spend my days defending the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 
I think there’s nothing more important than understanding that the Constitution restrains government, not the people. 
Thank you.
