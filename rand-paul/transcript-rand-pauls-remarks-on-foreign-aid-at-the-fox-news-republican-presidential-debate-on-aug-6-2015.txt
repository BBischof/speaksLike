Partial transcript of remarks by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Wisconsin) on foreign aid at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
Rand Paul:
I’ve put pencil to paper and I’ve said I would cut spending and I’ve said exactly where. 
Each one of my budgets has taken a meat axe to foreign aid because I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that hate us. 
I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that burn our flag. 
Israel isn’t one of those. But even Benjamin Netanyahu said that ultimately they will be stronger when they’re independent. 
My position is exactly the same. 
We shouldn’t borrow money from China to send it anywhere. But why don’t we start with eliminating aid to our enemies. 
Question:
Rand Paul:
Out of your surplus you can help your allies. And Israel is a great ally and this is no particular animus of Israel. 
But what I will say and I will say it over and over again, we cannot give away money we don’t have. We do not project power from bankruptcy court. 
We’re borrowing $1 million a minute. It’s got to stop somewhere.
