The remark was made that there hadn’t been anyone else on the podium opposed to the Iraq War. 
I’ve made my career as being an opponent of the Iraq War. 
I was opposed to the Syrian War. 
I was opposed to arming people who are our enemies. 
Iran is now stronger because Hussein is gone. Hussein is the great bulwark and counterbalance to the Iranians. 
So when we complain about the Iranians, you need to remember that the Iraq War made it worse. 
Originally, Gov. Bush was asked was the Iraq war a mistake and he said no, we’d do it again. 
We have to learn that sometimes interventions backfire. The Iraq War backfired and did not help us. We’re still paying the repercussions of a bad decision. 
We have to make that decision now in Syria. Should we topple Assad? 
Many up here wanted to topple Assad and in fact I said no because if you do ISIS would now be in charge.
