Partial transcript of remarks by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) on Republican hawks and ISIS at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
Now, you later said that that statement &#8211; you could have said it better. 
But the statement went on and you said “Everything they’ve talked about in foreign policy, they’ve been wrong for the last 20 years.” 
Why are you so quick to blame your own party? 
Rand Paul:
But we do have to examine how we’re going to defeat ISIS. 
I’ve got a proposal. I’m the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of ISIS. 
I’ve been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. 
ISIS rides around in a $1 billion worth of U.S. Humvees. It’s a disgrace. We have to stop it. We shouldn’t fund our enemy, for goodness sake. 
So we didn’t create ISIS. ISIS created themselves. But we will stop them and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them and by not arming them.
