I think this gets to the point of wisdom on when we should intervene and when we shouldn’t. 
Had we bombed Assad at the time like President Obama wanted, like Hillary Clinton wanted, and like many Republicans wanted, I think ISIS would be in Damascus today. I think ISIS would be in charge of Syria had we bombed Assad. 
Sometimes both sides of a civil war are evil and sometimes intervention makes us less safe. 
This is the real debate we have to have in the Middle East. 
Every time we’ve toppled a secular dictator, we’ve gotten chaos, the rise of radical Islam, and we’re more at risk. So I think we need to think before we act and know that most interventions, if not a lot of them in the Middle East, have actually backfired on us.
