Autism has become an epidemic.
25 years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics. Not even close.
It has gotten totally out of control.
I am totally in favor of vaccines but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time.
Because you take a baby in &#8211; and I’ve seen it and I’ve seen it and I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time, same exact amount. But you take this little beautiful baby and you pump &#8211; I mean, it looks just like it’s meant for a horse not for a child.
And we’ve had so many instances &#8211; people that work for me just the other day &#8211; two years old, two and a half years old, a child &#8211; a beautiful child &#8211; went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.
I only say &#8211; I’m in favor of vaccines. Do them over a longer period of time. Same amount but just in little sections.
And I think you’re going to have &#8211; I think you’re going to see a big impact on autism.
Ben Carson: 
But the fact of the matter is we have extremely well-documented proof that there’s no autism associated with vaccinations.
But it is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short period of time, and a lot of pediatricians now recognize that and I think are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done. And I think that’s appropriate.
