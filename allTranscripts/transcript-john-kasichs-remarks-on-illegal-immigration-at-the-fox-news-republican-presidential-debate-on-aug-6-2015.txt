Question:
John Kasich:
Hey, here’s the thing about Donald Trump. Donald Trump’s hitting a nerve in this country. He is. He’s hitting a nerve. People are frustrated. They’re fed up. They don’t think the government is working for them.
And for people that just want to tune him out, they’re making a mistake.
Now, he’s got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions.
You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington. Hadn’t been done since.
I was a military reformer. I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole and a 350,000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000 jobs.
Question:
John Kasich:
Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built. They want to see an end to illegal immigration. They want to see an end.
We all do but we all have different ways of getting there. And you’re going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are.
