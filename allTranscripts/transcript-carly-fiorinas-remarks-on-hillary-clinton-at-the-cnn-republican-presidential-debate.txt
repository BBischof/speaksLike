You see, Gov. Christie, people spend a lot of time talking about their track records and Mr. Trump and I have every right to do the same. 
And Mrs. Clinton is going to have to defend her track record. 
Her track record of lying about Benghazi, of lying about her emails, of lying about her servers. 
She does not have a track record accomplishment. 
Like Mrs. Clinton, I too have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe. But unlike Mrs. Clinton, I know that flying is an activity; it is not an accomplishment. 
Mrs. Clinton, if you want to stump a Democrat, ask them to name an accomplishment of Mrs. Clinton.
