Good evening. My story from secretary to CEO is only possible in this nation and proves every one of us has potential. 
My husband, Frank, of 30 years started out driving a tow truck for a family-owned auto body shop. 
We have come to a pivotal point in our nation’s history where this nation’s possibilities and potential are being crushed by a government grown so big, so powerful, so inept, so corrupt, and a political class that refuses to do anything about it. 
I am prepared to lead the resurgence of this great nation.
