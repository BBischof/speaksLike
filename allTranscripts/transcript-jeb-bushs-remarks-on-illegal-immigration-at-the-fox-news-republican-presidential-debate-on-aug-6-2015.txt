Partial transcript of remarks by former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Florida) on illegal immigration at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
I want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about illegal immigrants. And here’s what you said: “They broke the law but it’s not a felony. It’s an act of love. It’s an act of commitment to your family.”
Do you stand by that statement? And do you stand by your support for earned legal status?
Jeb Bush:
But we need to control our border. It’s our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in. 
I’ve written a book about this, and yes, this week I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that really mirrored what we said in the book, which is that we need to deal with E-Verify. 
We need to deal with people who come with a legal visa and overstay. 
We need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security. 
We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country. It’s ridiculous and tragic that people are dying because of the fact that local governments are not following the federal law. 
There’s much to do. 
And I think rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, which Barack Obama’s done now for six long years, the next president &#8211; and I hope to be that president &#8211; will fix this once and for all so that we can turn this into a driver for high sustained economic growth. 
And there should be a path to earned legal status for those that are here. Not amnesty. Earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time.
