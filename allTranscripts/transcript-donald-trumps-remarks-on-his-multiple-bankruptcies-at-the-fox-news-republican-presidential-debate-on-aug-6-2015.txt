Partial transcript of remarks by Donald Trump on his multiple bankruptcies at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
Trump corporations &#8211; Trump corporations &#8211; casinos and hotels have declared bankruptcy four times over the last quarter century. 
In 2011, you told Forbes Magazine this: “I’ve used the laws of the country to my advantage.” 
But at the same time, financial experts involved in those bankruptcies say that lenders to your companies lost billions of dollars. 
Question, sir, with that record, why should we trust you to run the nation’s business? 
Donald Trump:
I have never gone bankrupt by the way. I have never. 
But I’ve had hundreds of deals &#8211; 
Question:
Donald Trump:
But the difference is when somebody else uses those laws, nobody writes about it. When I use it, they say, “Oh, Trump, Trump, Trump.” 
The fact is I built a net worth of more than $10 billion. I have a great, great company. I employ thousands of people. And I’m very proud of the job I did. 
Again…hundreds and hundreds of deals, four times I’ve taken advantage of the laws and frankly so has everybody else in my position. 
Question:
Donald Trump:
These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, okay? I mean, you know, you’re living in a world of the make-believe…if you want to know the truth. 
I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City, which by the way, Caesar’s just went bankrupt, every company &#8211; Chris can tell you &#8211; every company virtually in Atlantic City went bankrupt. Every company. 
And let me just tell you. I had the good sense, and I’ve gotten a lot of credit in the financial pages. Seven years ago, I left Atlantic City before it totally cratered, and I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and I’m very proud of it. I want to tell you that. Very, very proud of it. 
By the way, this country, right now, owes $19 trillion and they need somebody like me to straighten out that mess.
