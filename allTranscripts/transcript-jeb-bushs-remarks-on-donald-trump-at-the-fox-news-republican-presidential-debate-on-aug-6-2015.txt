Question:
Jeb Bush:
I want to win. 
I want one of these people here or the ones at 5 p.m. to be the next President of the United States. 
We’re not going to win by doing what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do each and everyday &#8211; dividing the country, creating a grievance kind of environment. 
We’re going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message. 
I have that message because I was the governor of a state that saw people lifted up because we had high sustained economic growth. 
Our economy grew at doubled the rate of the nation. We created 1.3 million jobs. We led the nation seven out of those eight years. 
We were only one of two states that went to AAA bond rating. 
I cut taxes $19 billion. 
If you do that and apply conservative principles the right way, you create an environment where everybody rises up. 
That’s how we’re going to win &#8211; campaigning in places to give people hope that their life is better because too many people are suffering today in America. 
Donald Trump:
The one thing he did say &#8211; and I mean that. The one thing he did say about me however was my tone and I also understand that. 
But when you have people that are cutting Christians’ heads off, when you have a world at the border and at so many places that it’s medieval times, we’ve never &#8211; it’s almost got to be as bad as it ever was in terms of the violence and the horror, we don’t have time for tone. We have to go out and get the job done.
