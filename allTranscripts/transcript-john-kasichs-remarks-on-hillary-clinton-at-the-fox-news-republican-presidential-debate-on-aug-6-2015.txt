Partial transcript of remarks by Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) on Hillary Clinton at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
You know how she will come after whoever the Republican is. She will say that you or whoever it is support the rich while she supports the middle class. 
That you want to suppress the rights of women and minorities; she wants to move the country forward while you &#8211; the Republicans &#8211; want to take the country back to the past. 
How would you &#8211; if you’re the nominee &#8211; how will you answer that and take Hillary Clinton on? 
John Kasich:
But I think she will come in a narrow way. 
The nominee of this party if they’re going to win has got to come at it in a big way, which is pro-growth, which is balancing budgets. 
You know, we were talking about it. People were saying “Could we do it?” 
I was the chairman of the budget committee and the lead architect the last time it happened in Washington. And when we did it, we had great economic growth. We cut taxes and we had a big surplus. 
Economic growth is the key. Economic growth is the key to everything. 
But once you have economic growth, it is important that we reach out to people who live in the shadows, the people who don’t seem to ever think they’d get a fair deal and that includes people in our minority community, that includes people who feel as though they don’t have a chance to move up. 
You know, America is a miracle country and we have to restore the sense that the miracle will apply to you &#8211; each and every one of the people in this country who’s watching tonight, lift everybody, unite everybody, and build a stronger United States of America again. 
It will be and can be done.
