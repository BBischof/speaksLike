Well, I’m surprised Sen. Cruz would say that since he was a strong supporter of John Roberts at the time.
Look, I will talk about what I would do as President of the United States as it relates to appointing Supreme Court justices.
We need to make sure that we have justices that with a proven experience record of respect for upholding the Constitution. That is what we need.
We can’t have &#8211; the history in recent past is appoint people that have no experience so that you can’t get attacked.
And that makes it harder for people to have confidence that they won’t veer off on decisions.
…John Roberts has made some really good decisions for sure. But he did not have a proven extensive record that would have made clarity the important thing and that’s what we need to do.
And I’m willing to fight for those nominees to make sure that they get passed. You can’t do it the politically expedient way anymore.
This is the culture in Washington. You have to fight hard for these appointments. This is perhaps the most important thing that the next President will do.
