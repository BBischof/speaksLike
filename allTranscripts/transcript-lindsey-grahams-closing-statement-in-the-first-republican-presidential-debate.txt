Partial transcript of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham&#8217;s closing statement in the first Republican presidential debate hosted by Fox News on Aug. 6, 2015:
We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran; they’ve been killed a long time ago; that the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants “Death to America”, “Death to Israel”; and this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
We need a President who can solve our problems, bring us together.
We’re becoming Greece if we don’t work together.
At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together.
And I intend to put this country on a path to success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
