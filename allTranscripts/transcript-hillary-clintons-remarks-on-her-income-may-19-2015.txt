Question: 
Hillary Clinton:
So I think that most Americans understand that the deck is stacked for those at the top and I&#8217;m running a campaign that is very clearly stating we want to reshuffle that deck. We want to get back to having more opportunities for more people so that they can make more out of their own lives. And I think that&#8217;s exactly what America is looking for.
