â€¦The point that the black lives matter movement is making is a very, very legitimate and serious point and that is as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives, people of color. 
When I ran for mayor of Baltimore, we were burying over 350 young men every single year. Mostly young and poor and black. 
And I said to our legislature at the time when I appeared in front of them as a mayor that if we were burying white young poor men in these numbers we would be marching in the streets and there would be a different reaction. 
Black lives matter and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system and to address race relations in our country.
