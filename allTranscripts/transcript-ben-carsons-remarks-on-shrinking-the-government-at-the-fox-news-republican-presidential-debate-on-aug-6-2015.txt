Partial transcript of remarks by Dr. Ben Carson on reducing the size of the federal government at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question on reducing the size of the federal government: 
Dr. Ben Carson:
And the one that I’ve advocated is based on tithing because I think God’s a pretty fair guy. 
And he said if you give me a tithe, it doesn’t matter how much you make, if you’ve had a bumper crop, you don’t owe me triple tithes and you’d have no crops at all. You don’t owe me no tithes. 
So there must be something inherently fair about that, and that’s why I’ve advocated a proportion tax system. You make $10 billion, you pay $1 billion. You make $10, you pay $1. 
And everybody gets treated the same way and you get rid of the deductions and you get rid of all the loopholes.
And I have a lot more to say about it.
