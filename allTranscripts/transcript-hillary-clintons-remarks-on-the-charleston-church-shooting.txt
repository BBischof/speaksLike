				Part 1 of 5. Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&#8217;s remarks on the deadly mass shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Clinton&#8217;s remarks were made during a visit to Florissant (near Ferguson), Missouri on June 23, 2015: 
&#8230;I am here to listen but also to engage in the kind of open and honest discussion that I hope is happening all across America. 
Last week, just a few hours before the massacre at Mother Emanuel AME Church during Wednesday night&#8217;s Bible study, I was in Charleston visiting a technical school, meeting students &#8211; black, white, Hispanic &#8211; who were pursuing paid internships and learning skills that will prepare them for the jobs of the future. 
I heard their stories. I shook their hands. I looked into their eyes and I saw the hope and the pride that comes from doing work that is meaningful, learning, feeling that you matter and that there will be a place for you. 
That&#8217;s the basic bargain of our country. 
These young men and a few young women were doing their part. 
That night, word of the killings struck like a blow to the soul. 
How do we make sense of such an evil act? An act of racist terrorism perpetrated in a house of God. 
How do we turn grief, anger, and despair into purpose and action? 
Those of us who are Christians are challenged by Jesus Christ to forgive 70 times 7 &#8211; a daunting, even impossible task for most of us. 
But then we have seen that scriptural admonition in action. 
Isn&#8217;t it amazing &#8211; remarkable even &#8211; when fear, doubt, desire for revenge might have been expected but instead forgiveness is found? 
Although a fundamental part of our doctrine, its practice is the most difficult thing we are ever called to do. 
But that&#8217;s what we saw on Friday when one by one grieving parents, siblings, and other family members looked at that young man who had taken so much from them and said, &#8220;I forgive you.&#8221; 
Wanda Simmons, the granddaughter of Rev. Daniel Simmons said, &#8220;Although my grandfather and the other victims died at the hands of hate, this is proof &#8211; everyone&#8217;s plea for your soul&#8221;, she said to the killer, &#8220;is proof that they lived in love so hate won&#8217;t win.&#8221;

Clinton&#8217;s remarks were made during a visit to Florissant (near Ferguson), Missouri on June 23, 2015: 
Their act of mercy was as stunning as his act of cruelty. 
Hate cannot win. There is no future without forgiveness, Archbishop Desmond Tutu taught us. And forgiveness is the first step toward victory in any journey. 
I know it&#8217;s tempting to dismiss a tragedy like this as an isolated incident, to believe that in today&#8217;s America, bigotry is largely behind us, that insitutionalized racism no longer exists. 
But despite our best efforts and our highest hopes, America&#8217;s long struggle with race is far from finished. 
We can&#8217;t hide from hard truths about race and justice. We have to name them and own them and change them. 
That&#8217;s why I appreciate the actions begun yesterday by the governor and other leaders of South Carolina to remove the Confederate battle flags from the State House, recognizing it as a symbol of our nation&#8217;s racist past that has no place in our present or our future. 
It shouldn&#8217;t fly there. It shouldn&#8217;t fly anywhere. 
And I also commend Wal-Mart for deciding to remove any product that uses it. Today, Amazon, eBay, and Sears have followed suit and I urge all sellers to do the very same. 
But you know and I know that&#8217;s just the beginning of what we have to do. 
The truth is equality, opportunity, civil rights in America are still far from where they need to be. 
Our schools are still segregated. In fact, more segregated than they were in the 1960s. 
Nearly 6 million young Americans between the ages of 16 and 24 are out of school and out of work. Think of that. Neither learning nor working. The numbers are particularly high for young people of color. 
Statistics like these are rebukes to the real progress we have made, and they pose an urgent call for us to act publicly, politically, and personally. 
We should start by giving all of our children the tools and opportunities to overcome legacies of discrimination, to live up to their God-given potentials. 
I just saw some of the young people attending camp here at the church down in the basement, and I was thrilled to see that because that is the kind of commitment we need more of in every church, in every place, until every child is reached. 
And I hope we can take that as a cause for action.

Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&#8217;s remarks on the deadly mass shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Clinton&#8217;s remarks were made during a visit to Florissant (near Ferguson), Missouri on June 23, 2015: 
I learned this not from politics but from my mother who taught me that everybody &#8211; everybody &#8211; needs a chance and a champion. 
She knew what it was like to have neither one. Her own parents abandoned her. By 14, she was out on her own working as a housemaid. 
Years later when I was old enough to understand, I asked her, &#8220;What kept you going?&#8221; Her answer was very simple: Kindness along the way from someone who believed she mattered. 
All lives matter.
And for her, it was the first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and without embarassing her brought extra food to share. 
It was the woman whose house she cleaned who agreed to let her go to high school so long as her work got done. 
Because those people believed in her, gave her a chance, she believed in me. And she taught me to believe in the potential of every American. 
That inspired me to go to work for the Children&#8217;s Defense Fund after law school. It inspired me to work for the Legal Services Corporation, where I defended the rights of poor people to have lawyers. 
I saw lives changed because an abusive marriage ended or an illegal eviction stopped. 
In Arkansas, the law school there, I supervised law students who represented clients in courts and prisons, organized scholarship funds for single parents, led efforts for better schools and better health care. 
So I know &#8211; I know what personal kindness, political commitments, or public programs can do to help those who are trying their best to get ahead. 
That&#8217;s why we need to build an economy for tomorrow, not yesterday. 
You don&#8217;t have to look far from this sanctuary to see why that need is so urgent. But you also don&#8217;t have to look far to see that talent and potential is all right here if only we unleash. 
I believe that talent is universal but opportunity is not. We need to rebuild the American opportunities society for the 21st century. 
And you might ask: How do we do that? 
Well, first start looking at the faces and the energy of the young people I just saw downstairs. 
We have to start early, make sure every 4-year-old in America has access to high quality pre-school. Because those early years are when young brains develop and the right foundation can lead to lifelong success. 
Now, I&#8217;m not saying this just because I&#8217;m now a grandmother of the most amazing, brilliant, extraordinary 9-month-old in the history of the world. [Laughter]
I&#8217;m saying this because again, I know what the evidence is. 
I know that 80% of your brain is developed by the age of 3. 
So we have to do more. 
When I say &#8220;we&#8221; I mean churches and houses of worship. I mean businesses. I mean charities. I mean local governments. All of us have to do more to help families be their child&#8217;s first teachers from 0 to 5. 
&#8230;
You know, when I was First Lady of Arkansas, we struggled with this issue. We had a lot of kids &#8211; poor kids &#8211; in the Delta and South Arkansas, up in the mountains. And we were not going to be able to afford at that point all those years ago a universal pre-K program. We had to do more but we were never going to do enough. 
So, I looked for programs that people could run themselves. 
And I found a program in Israel. A program designed to help the children of immigrants into Israel, particularly from Ethiopia, who came with their parents seeking religious freedom. They were Ethiopian Jews. They had to escape. But many of them had never been to school. 
And the secret to the program called the Home Instruction Program for Pre-School Youngster was to teach the mother to teach her child. 
We need to do more of that and I call on all of us to find ways to reach into those families. 
And then as our kids grow up, they&#8217;re going to need not only a good education to prepare them but the skills for tomorrow&#8217;s jobs. 
We need tax credit for businesses that invest in apprenticeships, particularly providing opportunities to economically disadvantaged young people. 
In order to create those new jobs, we have to attract investment into communities too often ignored or written off. Whether you live in Ferguson or West Baltimore&#8230;you should have the same chance as any American anywhere to get ahead and stay ahead. 
We should reauthorize the New Markets Tax Credit which has encouraged billions of dollars in private funding for community development and small businesses in low-income, low investment areas. It should be permanent. 
A lot of new jobs are going to come from small businesses, and we know that women and people of color face extra hurdles becoming entrepreneurs. It&#8217;s harder to find support networks. It&#8217;s harder to get that loan. 
So we&#8217;ve got to do more to knock down the barriers so every good idea that anybody has will get a fair hearing and a chance to create a new business to employ people and raise their incomes. 
We must do all we can to be sure our communities respect law enforcement and that law enforcement respects the communities they serve. 
And we need to come together for common sense gun reforms that keep our communities safe. 
The key to all of this is revitalizing our democracy and finally persuading the 50 million Americans who do not vote that by not voting they make it possible for people who do not agree with them, do not support their aspirations to call the shots. 
Earlier this month, I went to Texas Southern University to speak out against systematic efforts to disempower and disenfranchise young people, poor people, people of color and the elderly. 
We need early voting in every state and automatic universal voter registration. I think every young American when they turn 18 should be universally automatically registered unless they say no. 
Now, if we restitch the fraying fabrics of our communities, we will only do so if all Americans do their part. 
&#8230;
I grew up in the Methodist church. My mother taught Sunday school, and made sure &#8211; part of the reason why she taught Sunday school was to keep an eye on my brothers who were supposed to be in Sunday school but you never knew. So she was there to make sure that they showed up in their classes. 
But she also made sure we heard the wisdom of John Wesley, the founder of Methodist, to do all the goods you can by all the means you can and all the ways you can in all the places you can at all the times you can to all the people you can as long as ever you can. 
And that meant more than prayer. It meant we had to step out of the church, roll up our sleeves, and get to work. 
I was blessed with a wonderful youth minister who took some of us into Chicago to hear Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. speak. 
I grew up in an all-white middle-class suburb. I didn&#8217;t have a black friend, neighbor, or classmate until I went to college. And I am so blessed to have had so many in my life since. 
But I leapt at the chance to hear Dr. King&#8217;s words. The sermon that evening was titled &#8220;Remaining Awake Through a Revolution&#8221;. 
Dr. King challenged us to stay engaged in the cause of justice, not to slumber while the world changed around us. 
I think that&#8217;s good advice for all of us today. We should all commit to stay awake and stay active to do our part in our families, our businesses, unions, houses of worships, schools, and yes in the voting booth. Never stop working for a stronger, more prosperous, more just, more inclusive America.
Government has a big part of the responsibility to promote growth, fairness, and justice. But so do all of us. 
So in quiet moments in the days ahead and honest conversations, let&#8217;s talk about what each of us can and should do because ultimately this is really all about the habits of our hearts &#8211; how we treat each other, how we learn to see the humanity in those around us, and how we teach our children to see that humanity too. 
And we don&#8217;t have to look far for examples. Those 9 righteous men and women who invited a stranger into their midst studied the Bible with him, someone who did not look like them, someone they had never seen before. Their example and their memory show us the way. Their families, their church does as well. 
So let us be resolved to make sure they did not die in vain, did not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good. 
Thank you and God bless you.
