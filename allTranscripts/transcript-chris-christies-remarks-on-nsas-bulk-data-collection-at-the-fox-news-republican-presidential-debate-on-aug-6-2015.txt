Question:
Do you really believe you can assign blame to Sen. Paul just for opposing the bulk collection of people’s phone records in the event of a terrorist attack? 
Chris Christie:
I was appointed U.S. Attorney by President Bush on Sept. 10, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day. 
And it happened in my state. This is not theoretical to me. I went to the funerals. We lost friends of ours in the Trade Center that day. My own wife was two blocks away from the Trade Center that day in her office having gone through it that morning. 
When you actually have to be responsible for doing this &#8211; and you can do it and we did it for seven years in my office respecting civil liberties and protecting the homeland. 
And I will make no apologies ever for protecting the lives and the safety of the American people.
We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that, not fewer, and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way. 
As President, that is exactly what I’ll do. 
Rand Paul:
The Fourth Amendment is what we fought the revolution over. John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence.  
And I’m proud of standing for the Bill of Rights and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights. 
Chris Christie:
How are you supposed to know? 
…Listen, Senator, you know when you’re sitting in the subcommittee just blowing hot air about this, you could say things like that. When you’re responsible for protecting the lives of the American people, then what you need to do is to make sure that you use the system the way it’s supposed to work. 
Rand Paul:
Every time you did a case, you got a warrant from a judge. I’m talking about searches without warrants indiscriminately of all Americans’ records, and that’s what I’ve fought to end. 
I don’t trust President Obama with our records. I know that you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead.
