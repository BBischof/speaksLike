…Let’s talk about the future. We need the strongest military on the face of the planet and everyone has to know it. 
And specifically what that means is we need about 50 army brigades. 
We need about 36 marine battalions. 
We need somewhere between 300 and 350 naval ships. 
We need to upgrade every leg of the nuclear triad. 
We need to reform the Department of Defense. 
We need as well to invest in our military technology. 
And we need to care for our veterans so 307,000 of them aren’t dying waiting for health care.
