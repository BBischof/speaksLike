…The single biggest national security threat facing America right now is the threat of a nuclear Iran. 
We’ve seen six and a half years of President Obama leading from behind. Weakness is provocative in this Iranian nuclear deal is nothing short of catastrophic. 
This deal on its face will send over $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khomeini, making the Obama administration’s the world leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism. 
This deal abandons four American hostages in Iran and this deal will only accelerate Iran’s acquiring of nuclear weapons. You’d better believe it. 
If I am elected President on the very first day in office, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. 
Well, let’s be clear when it comes to experience.
What President Obama wants to do is he’s run to the United Nations and he wants to use the United Nations to bind the United States and take away our sovereignty. 
Well, I spent five and a half years as the solicitor general of Texas &#8211; the lead lawyer for the state in front of the U.S. Supreme Court &#8211; and I went in front of the Supreme Court and took on the world court and the United Nations in a case called Medellin v. Texas and we won a historic victory saying that the world’s court and the U.N. to bind the United States and no President of the United States &#8211; Republican or Democrat &#8211; has the authority to give away our sovereignty. 
And so if there’s anyone up here who would be bound by this catastrophic deal with Iran, they’re giving up the core responsibility of commander-in-chief and as President I would never do that.
