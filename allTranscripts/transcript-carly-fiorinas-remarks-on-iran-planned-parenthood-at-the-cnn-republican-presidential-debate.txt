I’d like to link these two issues both of which are incredibly important &#8211; Iran and Planned Parenthood. 
One has something to do with the defense of the security of this nation. The other has something to do with the defense of the character of this nation. 
You have not heard about a plan from Iran from any politician up here. 
Here’s my plan: On day one in the Oval Office, I will make two phone calls. The first to my good friend Bibi Netanyahu to reassure him we will stand with the state of Israel. The second to the Supreme Leader to tell him that unless and until he opens every military and every nuclear facility to real anytime, anywhere inspections by our people &#8211; not his &#8211; we the United States of America will make it as difficult as possible to move money around the global financial system. We can do that. We don’t need anyone’s cooperation to do it. 
And every ally and every adversary we have in this world will know that the United States of America is back in the leadership business, which is how we must stand with our allies. 
As regards to Planned Parenthood, anyone who has watched this video tape, I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, to watch these tapes. To watch a fully formed fetus on the table. Its heart beating. Its legs kicking while someone says “We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.” 
This is about the character of our nation, and if we will not stand up and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us.
