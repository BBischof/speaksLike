A Christie presidency won’t be about me; it’ll be about you.
Tonight, you sit at home in your living room frustrated that you play by the rules, you pay the taxes, you do the hard things to raise your family. Yet you feel like America’s generosity is being taken advantage of, that the system is being gamed, and that you’re turning out to fall further and further behind.
Our presidency &#8211; our presidency &#8211; will be about ending that, about enforcing the law, level the playing fields for everybody, and once against reward those folks who play by the rules and think that justice means more than just a word but it means a way of life.
And I will tell you this around the world. I will not shake hands with, I will not meet with and I will not agree to anything with a country that says death to us, death to Israel and holds our hostages while we sign agreements with them.
It will be an America that will be strong and resolute and will once again be able to stick out its chest and say “We truly are the greatest nation in the world because we live our lives that way each and every day.”
