…I think there’s lessons to be learned from Benghazi and those lessons are that we need to do a much better job as a nation of having human intelligence on the ground so that we know who the emerging next generation leaders are that are coming up to replace a dictator when his time on this planet ends. And I believe that’s what Chris Stevens was trying to do but he did not have the tools. 
We have failed as a country to invest in the human intelligence that would allow us to make not only better decisions in Libya but better decisions in Syria today. 
And it’s a huge national security failing.
