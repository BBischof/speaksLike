Carly Fiorina: 
We talked about it in 2012. We talked about it in 2008. We talked it in 2004. 
Donald Trump: 
Carly Fiorina: 
First, let me say we have spent a good bit of time discussing as Republicans how to solve this problem. 
I would ask your audience at home to ask a very basic question: Why have Democrats not solved this problem? 
President Obama campaigned in 2007 and 2008 on solving the immigration problem. 
He entered Washington with majorities in the House and the Senate. He could have chosen to do anything to solve this problem. 
Instead he chose to do nothing. Why? Because the Democrats don’t want this issue solved. They want it to be an issue that they can use. 
As to birthright citizenship, the truth is you can’t just wave your hands and say the 14th Amendment is going to go away. 
It will take an extremely arduous vote in Congress followed by two-thirds of the states. 
And if that doesn’t work to amend the Constitution then it is a long arduous process in court. 
And meanwhile what will continue to go on is what has gone on for 25 years. 
With all due respect, Mr. Trump, we have been talking about illegal immigration for 25 years. San Francisco has been a sanctuary city since 1989. There are 300 of them. 
And meanwhile what has happened? Nothing. 
The border remains insecure. The legal immigration system remains broken. 
Look, we know what it takes to secure the border. We’ve heard a lot of great ideas here &#8211; money, manpower, technology. Mostly apparently, leadership &#8211; the kind of leadership that understands how to get results.
