Partial transcript of remarks by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on ISIS at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
How would you destroy ISIS in 90 days? 
Ted Cruz:
We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a President unwilling to utter the words “radical Islamic terrorism”.
When I asked Gen. Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, what would be required militarily to destroy ISIS, he said “There is no military solution. We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization.” 
That, with all due respect, is nonsense. 
It’s the same answer that the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs. 
What we need is a commander-in-chief who makes clear if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant. 
Question:
Ted Cruz:
Yes, it is ideological. 
And let me contrast President Obama who at the prayer breakfast essentially acted as an apologist. He said, “Well gosh, the Crusades, the Inquisitions.” 
We need a President that shows the courage that Egypt’s President El-Sisi did &#8211; a Muslim &#8211; when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world.
