Partial transcript of former New York Governor George Pataki&#8217;s closing statement in the first Republican presidential debate hosted by Fox News on Aug. 6, 2015:
With all the candidates, why me?
My background is different.
I look at Washington and I hear the talk and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes. Washington gets bigger. Taxes get higher. And the American people feel more distanced from our government.
I had the opportunity not just to run but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
And not only did I win but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest, reducing our welfare rolls by over a million and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
I can govern by bringing people together.
And also I’ve been tested in a way no one else has. I was governor on Sept. 11th and I’m proud of my leadership in bringing New York through bad times.
And when I left we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
We need to bring people together in Washington. The talk has got to stop. The action has got to begin. People can promise you something. I delivered it in the blue state of New York. I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
