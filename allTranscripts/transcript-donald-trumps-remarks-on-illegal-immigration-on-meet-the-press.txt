Partial transcript of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump&#8217;s remarks on combating illegal immigration on Meet The Press on Aug. 16, 2015:
Hardline, comprehensive. It will stop the problem.
&#8230;
They have the money. They have the money. And they&#8217;re making a fortune. Mexico is doing very well.
&#8230;
They have the money. They will pay for the wall.
They&#8217;re sending drugs and they&#8217;re taking money out. They&#8217;re making a lot of money. Mexico&#8217;s making a lot of money.
And I&#8217;m a big fan of Mexico. I&#8217;m a huge fan of the Mexican people. I have thousands of Mexican people working for me right now and have over the years. But they have to pay for the wall.
And we need the wall.
Do you know that 10 years ago Hillary and everybody wanted a wall? And then they said, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s too expensive.&#8221; You know one of the reasons? Environmental impact&#8230;
&#8230;
I&#8217;m the best builder in the country.
&#8230;
You have to get rid of [birthright citizenship]. Yes, you have to. What they&#8217;re doing &#8211; they&#8217;re having a baby and all of a sudden, nobody knows &#8211;
&#8230;
You have no choice. You have no choice. Let me tell you, when we have some good people &#8211; we have some really good people here. We have a lot of really good people. They&#8217;re illegal.
You either have a country or not. And we&#8217;re going to try and bring them back rapidly, the good ones, rapidly.
&#8230;
You know the word expedited? Expedited.
&#8230;
The executive order [DACA] gets rescinded. You&#8217;re going to have to.
We have to make a whole new set of standards and when people come in they have to come in legally.
&#8230;
No, we&#8217;re going to keep the families together. We have to keep the together but they have to go. They have to go&#8230;We will work with them. They have to go.
&#8230;
We either have a country or we don&#8217;t have a country. Either we have a country or not.
&#8230;
Look at the cost of what we have right now&#8230;Do you think there&#8217;s tremendous cost for the illegals that are in here right now? Okay. Tremendous.
Do you think there&#8217;s tremendous crime being committed by illegals? Tremendous. Far greater than &#8211; and you see it all over just last night. All over.
And we will do it and we will expedite it so people can come back in. The good people can come back in.
&#8230;
Yeah, but you have incompetent politicians. You have bad managers. They&#8217;re all talk; they&#8217;re no actions&#8230;They&#8217;re incompetent.
&#8230;
&#8230;
You can run [government] like a business with heart. What people don&#8217;t know about me &#8211; I have a lot of heart.
&#8230;
It will work out so well. You will be so happy. In four years, you&#8217;re going to be interviewing me and you&#8217;re going to say &#8220;What a great job you&#8217;ve done, President Trump.&#8221;
You&#8217;re going to say, &#8220;You have done one of the great jobs.&#8221; It&#8217;s going to happen.
And you know what? The good are going to be able to come back but they&#8217;re going to come back legally.
We have to have a country. We have to have a great country.
Also, I want to bring people that are going to really help us not all at the low end&#8230;And I&#8217;ve been hearing more and more of this &#8211; we have to bring people that are university &#8211; you know, go to universities, that are doctors. We need a lot of people like that.
&#8230;
But we&#8217;re spending a lot of money right now by keeping all of this crime.
&#8230;
You have the Department of Education. You have so much money being spent. I&#8217;m going to have it pared down to very little because I&#8217;m not a Common Core &#8211; Jeb Bush wants Common Core. It&#8217;s a disaster.
&#8230;
EPA &#8211; look at them. Look at the river. What happened. EPA. I wonder if somebody&#8217;s going to sue them now.
You know, they&#8217;re fining everybody all the time they&#8217;re fining.
&#8230;
We need less government, and we will save a fortune.
As far as immigration&#8217;s concerned, we need the wall. We want people to come in. I want to come in. They have to be wonderful people; they have to come in legally.
You know, if you&#8217;re in Mexico, it&#8217;s almost impossible to become a citizen of Mexico? And with us, they just walk across the border.
&#8230;
Okay, they want to come here. But a lot of them come here, take the money, and go back into Mexico and the other countries because they still want to stay at their own country.
You would be amazed. They want to stay in their own country. They have a loyalty to their own country.
They come here. They take our money, then they go back.
I&#8217;m not saying they it illegally &#8211; in many cases they don&#8217;t. In some cases we have problems.
But they come into this country, they take the money, they go back home into one of many countries. I don&#8217;t like that.
