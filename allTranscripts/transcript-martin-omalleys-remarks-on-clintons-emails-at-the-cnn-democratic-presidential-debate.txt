I believe that now that we’re finally having debates…that we don’t have to be defined by the email scandal and what the FBI is asking about. 
Instead, we can talk about affordable college, making college debt free, and all the issues, which is why &#8211; and I see the chair of the DNC here &#8211; look how glad we are actually to be talking about the issues that matter most to people around their kitchen table. 
We need to get wages to go up, college more affordable, and we need to make America 100% clean electric by 2050.
