Partial transcript of former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum&#8217;s closing statement in the first Republican presidential debate hosted by Fox News on Aug. 6, 2015:
I’ll tell you how optimistic I am about America. Karen and I have seven children. You don’t have seven children and bring them into this world if you’re not optimistic about the future of this country.
I am, but people are upset and they’re upset for a reason about the future of this country.
Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration. And I think he did because immigration is sort of an example of what’s broken and what’s wrong in Washington, D.C.
You see, you have one side &#8211; the Democrats &#8211; and with immigration all they care about is votes. They don’t care about American workers. They just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
On the other side, you have so many Republicans and what do they care about? Helping businesses make profits.
There’s nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
I’m looking out for the American worker.
I’m the only one in this stage who has a plan that’s actually going to reduce immigration, actually do something to help the American worker.
And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing &#8211; this country number one in manufacturing, you’ve got someone who’s going to help revitalize and give hope to America with the place that is most hopeless today.
That’s why I ask for your support for President.
