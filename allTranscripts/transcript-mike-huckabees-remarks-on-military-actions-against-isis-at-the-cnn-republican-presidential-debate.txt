I love the idea of a good intellectual capacity to deal with our enemies. 
But the fact is if you don’t have good intelligence that’s reliable and that’s honest, you’re not going to have good intelligence and you cannot make good decisions. 
The next President is primarily elected not just to know things but to know what to do with the things that he knows. And the most dangerous person in any room is the person who doesn’t know what he doesn’t know. 
And the reason Barack Obama has been dangerous to this country and we better elect someone who’s had some executive experience is because we cannot afford another eight years having a person in the office who doesn’t know what he does not know.
