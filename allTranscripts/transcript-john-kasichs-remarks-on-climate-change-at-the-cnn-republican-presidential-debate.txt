For a rural &#8211; the Obama administration EPA has said we’ll have a marginal impact on climate change.
So we’re going to put thousands and thousands of jobs in my state &#8211; I think it’s something like 30,000 in Ohio &#8211; other states across this country, we’re going to put people &#8211; manufacturing jobs &#8211; the kind of jobs that are far greater than minimum wage. This administration is willing to put at risk for something that its own EPA says it marginal.
