I have a different idea. I think we ought to get rid of all of the taxes on people who produce. 
Why should we penalize productivity? 
And it’s why I’m an unabashed supporter of the Fair Tax, which would be a tax on our consumption rather than a tax on our productivity. 
In other words, you’re not going to tax anybody for what they earn, whether it’s a worker who’s working by the hour or whether it’s a hedge fund manager. They can produce something and bring capital and labor to create jobs. We need some jobs. 
And I think the fair tax makes more sense. 
Now, Jake, I’ve been listening to everybody on this stage and there’s a lot of back and forth about “I’m the only one who’s done. The only one who’s done that. I’ve done great things.” 
We’ve all done great things or we wouldn’t be on this stage. 
But it occurs to me as we’re sitting here in the Reagan Library that most of us would like to pay tribute to a guy who when he got elected didn’t get elected telling everybody how great he was; he got elected telling everybody how great the American people were and he empowered them to live their dreams, which is what I’d love to see us do by no longer penalizing the people who are out there working because they’re taking a gut punch right now.
