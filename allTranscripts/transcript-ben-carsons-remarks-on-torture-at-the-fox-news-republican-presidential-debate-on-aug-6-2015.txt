Partial transcript of remarks by Dr. Ben Carson on torture at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
Dr. Ben Carson:
And I wouldn’t necessarily be broadcasting to everybody what we’re going to do. 
You know, we’ve gotten into this mindset of fighting politically correct war. There is no such thing as a politically correct war. 
The left of course will say “Carson doesn’t believe in the Geneva Convention”; Carson doesn’t believe in fighting stupid wars.  
And what we have to remember is we want to utilize the tremendous intellect that we have in the military to win wars. 
And I’ve talked to a lot of the generals, a lot of our advance people, and believe me, if we gave them the mission, which is what the commander-in-chief does, they would be able to carry it out. And if we don’t tie their hands behind their back, they will do it extremely effectively.
