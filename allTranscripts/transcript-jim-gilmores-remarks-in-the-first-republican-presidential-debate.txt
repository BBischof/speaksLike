[Question on electability]
I think the times are different now. I think the times are much more serious.
Because of the Obama-Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
I want to reverse that decline. That’s why I’ve entered this race.
But I think I have the experience to do it: Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor. I was elected to all of those offices.
A person who in fact has a long experience in foreign policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors…who are running.
I was an Army intelligence agent, a veteran during the Cold War assigned to West Germany.
I was the Chairman on the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism of the United States for five years.
I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues. I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
I understand both of these issues &#8211; how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who built jobs and cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign policy issues. And that’s why I entered this race.

[Question on preventing homegrown terrorism]
And I’m going to tell you this: We need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country combined with our intelligence people across this country.
We need to use our technological advantages because what we’ve warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country. It’s going to happen in this country. There are going to be further attacks.
We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country.

[Question on cutting back on entitlement and benefits]
I&#8217;ll tell them that we&#8217;re going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don&#8217;t have to rely exclusively on benefits or programs.
Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
And I&#8217;m glad that I have a chance to answer those questions.
I&#8217;ve had the growth code oath there for about five years and it&#8217;s this specific program we&#8217;re going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
We&#8217;re going to have a three bracket tax code &#8211; 10%, 15%, and 25%.
We&#8217;re going to combine all commercial activity and business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15%, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world and we&#8217;re going to eliminate the death tax.
With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do. It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
And first of all, we&#8217;ve got to recognize that there is a problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused, and that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen, and Obamacare.
These are drags on the economy. It&#8217;s a deliberate drag. I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.

[Question on an abortion litmus test for Supreme Court nominees]
Well, as you know, I&#8217;m a former elected prosecutor, a former elected Attorney General, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don&#8217;t believe in litmus tests except this: I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
Now, the challenge we&#8217;re seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body. They have to have
And my goal is appointing Supreme Court justices would be to appoint justices who will follow the law.
[No litmus test?]
Not on that, no.
But let me say one more thing. Before my time runs out, I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran. It is Iran that&#8217;s the expansionist power. ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state. Our job has to be to recognize the conflict bewteen the two.
I have proposed that there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to the Iranian expansion and at the same time join together to begin to stop and end this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
&#8230;
[Question on the first executive order]
Well, it&#8217;s not a matter of what the first executive order would be&#8230;It&#8217;s a matter of what orders exist now that shouldn&#8217;t exist. 
The President has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal &#8211; illegal &#8211; and it creates a contempt for the law, for the rule of law. 
If I were the President of the United States, I&#8217;d go look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones I want to be voided because the President shouldn&#8217;t be legislating, not through that vehicle or any other. We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
