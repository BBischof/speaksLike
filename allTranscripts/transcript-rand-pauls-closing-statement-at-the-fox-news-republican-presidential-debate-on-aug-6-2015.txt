Partial transcript of closing remarks by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
I&#8217;m a different kind of Republican. 
I&#8217;ve introduced a five-year balanced budget. I&#8217;ve introduced the largest tax cut in our history. 
I stood for 10.5 hours on the Senate floor to defend your right to be left alone. 
But I&#8217;ve also gone to Chicago. I&#8217;ve gone to Detroit. I&#8217;ve been to Ferguson. I&#8217;ve been to Baltimore because I want our party to be bigger, better and bolder. 
And I&#8217;m the only one that leads Hillary Clinton in five states that were won by President Obama. 
I&#8217;m a different kind of Republican.
