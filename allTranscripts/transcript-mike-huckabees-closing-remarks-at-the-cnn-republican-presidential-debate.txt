At the end of my presidency, I would like to believe that the world would be a safe place.
And there wouldn’t be the threats not only to the U.S. but to Israel and our allies because we would have the most incredible well-trained, well-equipped, well-prepared military in the history of mankind and they would know that the commander in chief would never send them to a mission without all the resources necessary.
That people wouldn’t bully us anymore because they would know that that would be an invitation to their destruction.
Domestically, we’d be operating under a tax system that eliminated the IRS. People wouldn’t be punished for their work and for what they produced.
And life would be really deemed precious. Abortion would be no more. It would be as much as a scourge in our past as slavery is.
And we’d have a peaceful country where people respected each other and people respected law enforcement.
And we would focus on cures, and we would make this country not on safe from our enemies without and safe from enemies within. It would be a good place to raise our kids and our grandkids.
