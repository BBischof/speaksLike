I think one of the great problems and what the American people don’t like about politics is hypocrisy. People who have one standard for others and not for themselves.
There is at least one prominent example on this stage of someone who says they smoked pot in high school and yet the people going to jail for this are poor people, often African-Americans and often Hispanics. Yet the rich kids who use drugs aren’t.
I personally think this is a crime for which the only victim is the individual, and I think America has to take a different attitude.
I’d like to see more rehabilitation and less incarceration.
I’m a fan of the drug courts which try to direct you back towards work and less time in jail.
But the bottom line is states we say we like the Tenth Amendment until we start talking about this.
And I think the federal government’s gone too far. I think that the war on drugs has had a racial outcome, and really it’s been something that’s really damaged our inner cities. Not only do the drugs damage them. We damage them again by incarcerating them and then preventing them from getting employment over time.
So I don’t think the federal government should override the states. I believe in the Tenth Amendment and I really will say that the states are left to themselves.
