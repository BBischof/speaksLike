It was a big deal because he was the grassroots running against the establishment.
And I’ll never forget that. And how we stood up and said, “You know what this is something new that our country needs and our party needs.”
If I were President, I would try to be one who says, “You know what? I’m a Reagan conservative. I’m someone who believes in peace through strength and I would try to lead the country in that way knowing that our goal is peace and that war is the last resort, not the first resort. And that when we go to war, we go to war in a constitutional way, which means that we have to vote on it, that war is initiated by the Congress, not by the President, and that we go to war reluctantly but then when we go to war, we don’t fight with one arm tied behind our back. We fight all out to win but then we come home.”
