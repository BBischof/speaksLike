…This is an issue that we’ve got to talk about and we haven’t talked about yet.
71% of all federal spending is on entitlements and debt service. When John Kennedy was elected in 1960, it was 26%.
Harvard and Dartmouth say that Social Security is going to go insolvent in seven to eight years.
So what I say is very simple. We need to save this program for the good people out there who have paid into the system and need it.
And if that means making sure that folks like Donald and many of us on this stage don’t get it, that’s the right thing to do.
Because here’s what Hillary Clinton’s going to want to do. She’s going to want to put more money into a system that’s already lied to us and stolen from us.
This government doesn’t need more money to make Social Security solvent. We need to be not paying out benefits to people who don’t really need it.
We need to protect the people who Social Security means the difference between picking between heat and rent and food.
That’s why I put out the proposal…
