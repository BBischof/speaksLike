Radical Islamic terrorism cannot be solved by intellect. They require &#8211; what they need is they need an operating space. 
That’s what Afghanistan was for Al Qaeda. It was a vacuum that they filled and they created an operating space. 
That’s what they had to be drawn out of there. That’s why they had to be destroyed.  
It is the reason why ISIS has now grown as well. We allowed them &#8211; we allowed a vacuum to emerge in Syria. They used it as an operating space to grow. And today, they’re not just in Iraq and Syria anymore. They’re now in Libya conducting operations in the Sinai. They’re now in Afghanistan trying to supplant the Taliban as the most powerful radical jihadist group on the ground there as well. 
You cannot allow radical jihadists to have an operating safe haven anywhere in the world.
