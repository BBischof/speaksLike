				
Iâ€™m John Kasich, the governor of Ohio. 
Emma and Resse, my children, and Karen &#8211; love you girls. Thanks for watching tonight. 
By the way, I think I actually flew on this plane with Ronald Reagan when I was a congressman and his goals and mine really were pretty much the same &#8211; lift Americans, unify, give hope, grow America, and restore it to that great shining city on a hill. 
Yes, he was a great one and I learned much from watching him. 
The most important thing &#8211; hope to Americans, unify, lift everyone in America.
