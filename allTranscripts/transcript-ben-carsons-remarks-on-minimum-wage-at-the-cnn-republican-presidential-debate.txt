Well, first of all, let me say what I actually said about raising the minimum wage. 
I was asked should it be raised? I said probably or possibly. 
But what I added, which I think is the most important thing, is I said we need to get both sides of this issue to sit down and talk about it and negotiate a reasonable minimum wage and index that so that we never have to have this conversation again in the history of America. 
I think we also have to have two minimum wages &#8211; a starter and a sustaining &#8211; because how are young people ever going to get a job if you have such a high minimum wage that it makes impracticable to hire them?
