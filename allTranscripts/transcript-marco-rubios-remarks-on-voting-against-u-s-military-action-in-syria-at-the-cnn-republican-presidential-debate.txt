…We had zero responsibility. Because let’s remember what the President said. He said that the attack that he was going to conduct was going to be a pinprick. 
Well, the United States military was not built to conduct pinprick attacks. 
If the United States military was going to be engaged by a commander-in-chief, it should only be engaged in an endeavor to win. 
And we are not going to authorize use of force if you’re not putting men and women in a position where they can win. And quite frankly people don’t trust this President as commander in chief because of that.
