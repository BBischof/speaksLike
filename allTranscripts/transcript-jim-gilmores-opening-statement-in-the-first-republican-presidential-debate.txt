Partial transcript of former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore&#8217;s opening statement in the first Republican presidential debate hosted by Fox News on Aug. 6, 2015:
Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia. I governed that way, and that’s my track record.
But the key thing that we’re seeing now is serious challenges of this country that must change. The direction of this country must change.
And that’s why I’ve offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
I have the experience as a prosecutor, Attorney General, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the terrorism commission for this country.
It’s time for real substance and real experience, and that’s what I’ll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
