Six million more people are living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected President.
Six million more people. The middle class has had declining income. Workforce participation rates are lower than they were in 1977.
For the first time in modern history, more businesses are failing than are being created.
That is what the next President will to deal with.
And I believe we can reverse course by creating a strategy of high sustained economic growth, not the new normal of 2% that all the left says we just have to get used to but a 4% growth strategy where we reform how we tax, fix the broken regulatory system, embrace the energy revolution in our midst, fix the immigration system so we can turn it into an economic driver, deal with the structural fiscal problems that exists because of our entitlement problems that will overwhelm and create way too much debt.
If we grow at 4%, people are going to be lifted out of poverty. The great middle that defines our country will have a chance to be able to pursue their dreams as they see fit.
That should be the great challenge and the great opportunity for the next President of the United States &#8211; to forge consensus, to go back to a high growth strategy &#8211; and then weâ€™ll be able to lead the world.
Without a high growth strategy, our country will never have the resources or the optimism to be able to lead the world which the world desperately needs our leadership.
