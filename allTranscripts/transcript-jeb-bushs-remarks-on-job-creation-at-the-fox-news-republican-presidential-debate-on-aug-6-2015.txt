Partial transcript of remarks by former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Florida) on job creation at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
That many jobs &#8211; 19 million &#8211; would be triple what your father and your brother accomplished together. 
And 4% growth. The last President to average that was Lyndon Johnson during the height of the Vietnam War. 
So question: How on Earth specifically would you pull that off? 
Jeb Bush:
I think we need to lift our spirits and have high lofty expectations for this great country of ours. 
The new normal of the 2% that the left is saying you can’t do anything about is so dangerous for our country. 
There are 6 million people living in poverty today more than when Barack Obama got elected. 
6.5 million people are working part-time, most of whom want to work full-time. 
We’ve created rules and taxes on top of every aspiration of people, and the net result is we’re not growing fast, income’s not growing. 
A 4% growth strategy means you fix a convoluted tax code. You get in and you change every aspect of regulations that are job killers. 
You get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn’t suppress wages and kill jobs. 
You embrace the energy revolution in our country. 
This President and Hillary Clinton who can’t even say she’s for the XL Pipeline even after she’s left. 
Give me a break. Of course we’re for it. We should be for these things to create high sustained economic growth. 
And frankly fixing our immigration system and turning it into an economic driver is part of this as well. 
We can do this.
