Partial transcript of closing remarks by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
You know, both of my parents were born to poor families on the island. They came to America because it was the only place where people like them could have a chance. 
Here in this country, they never made it big but the very purpose of their life was to give us the chance to do all the things they never could. 
My father was a bartender. And the journey from the back of that bar to this stage tonight to me that&#8217;s the essence of the American dream. 
It&#8217;s what makes our nation different. 
And I&#8217;m running for President because I want that to still be possible for the people trying to do that now. 
I run for President because I believe that we can&#8217;t just save the American dream, we can expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. 
And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m asking for your vote so we can make a grand America greater than it&#8217;s ever been and make of this century a new American century.
