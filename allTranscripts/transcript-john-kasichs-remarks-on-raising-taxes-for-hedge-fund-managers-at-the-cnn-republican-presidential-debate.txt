I don’t at this point in terms of changing the incentives for investments and risk-taking. 
But let’s just stop for a second. 
There’s one person on this stage that does have a record. 
I’m the only person on this stage and one of the few people in this country that led the effort as the chief architect at the last time we balanced the federal budget. We also cut taxes. 
And when I left Washington in 2000, we had a $5 trillion surplus and the economy was booming. 
I’ve spent 10 years of my life to get us to that point. 
Went out the private sector &#8211; it was great experience. 
Went into Ohio and turned an $8 billion hole and turned it into a $2 billion surplus. 
We’ve had the largest amount of tax cuts of any sitting governor. 
We’ve grown well over 300,000 jobs. 
You see, I’ve done it in both places. I’m the only one here that’s done it in both places. 
It took a lot to get us to a balanced budget. It was legitimate. It was real and we negotiated. 
A lot of what we’re talking about here tonight is we’re going to take this position and that position. 
You know what? At the end of the day, America’s got to work. 
We’ve got to figure out how we come together to deal with our fiscal problems because when we deal with that we create a stronger economy for everybody. People have a chance to rise. 
So you know, when we think about how we make a choice, it’s the person that lands that plane. It’s not somebody that talks about it. It’s about the person who’s done it. 
And I’ve done it in both places and I did it including people in the other party, and that’s how we were successful and that’s how I will be President, using that experience to drive this country forward.
