Typically, politicians do things that are politically expedient and they are looking for whatever their particular goal is. 
That is not the reason that I have gotten into this thing. 
I am extraordinarily concerned about the direction of this country, the divisiveness that is going on, the fiscal irresponsibility, the failure to take a leadership position in the world. 
All of those things will lead to a situation where the next generation will not have a chance that we’ve had now. 
So I don’t really want to get into describing who’s a politician and who’s not a politician. 
But I think the people have kind of made that decision for themselves already and will continue to do so as time goes on.
