I’m proud to serve in the United States Senate. 
You know, when I ran five years ago, the entire leadership of my party in Washington lined up against me. 
But I’m glad I won and I’m glad I ran because this country’s headed in the wrong direction and if we keep electing the same people nothing is going to change. 
And you’re right, I have missed some votes and I’ll tell you why, Mr. Trump. 
Because in my years in the Senate, I figured out very quickly that the political establishment in Washington, D.C. in both political parties is completely out of touch with the lives of our people. 
You have millions of people living in this country living paycheck to paycheck and nothing’s being done about it. 
We are about to leave our children with $18 trillion in debt and they’re about to raise the debt limit again. 
We have a world that grows increasingly dangerous and we are eviscerating our military spending and signing deals with Iran. 
And if this thing continues, we are going to be the first Americans to leave our children worst off than ourselves. 
That’s why I’m missing votes because I am leaving the Senate. I am not running for re-election. 
And I’m running for President because I know this: Unless we have the right President, we cannot make America fulfill its potential. 
But with the right person in office, the 21st century can be the greatest era that our nation has ever known.
