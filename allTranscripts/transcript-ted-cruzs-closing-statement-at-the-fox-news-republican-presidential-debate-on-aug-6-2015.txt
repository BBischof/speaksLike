Partial transcript of closing remarks by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
If I&#8217;m elected President, let me tell you about my first day in office. 
The first thing I intend to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama. 
The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these videos and to prosecute Planned Parenthood for any criminal violations. 
The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice and the IRS to start persecuting religious liberty [sic]. 
And then I intend to cancel the Iran deal and finally move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. 
I will keep my word. My father fled Cuba and I will fight to defend liberty because my family knows what it&#8217;s like to lose it.
