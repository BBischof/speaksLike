I’m Mike Huckabee. I’m delighted to be on this stage with some remarkable fellow Republicans. 
None of us are a self-professed socialist. None of us on this stage are under investigation by the FBI because we destroyed government records or because we leaked secrets. 
I know that there are some in the Wall Street to Washington axis of power who speak of all of us contemptuously. 
But I’m here to say that I think we are in fact the A-Team. We have some remarkable people. 
And in fact, not only are we the A-Team, we even have our own Mr. T, who doesn’t mind saying about others “You’re a fool”. 
And I’m delighted to be here with all of these guys and would put any of them in an administration that I led. 
Thank you very much.
