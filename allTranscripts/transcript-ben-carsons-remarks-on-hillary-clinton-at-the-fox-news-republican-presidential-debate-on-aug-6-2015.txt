Partial transcript of remarks by Dr. Ben Carson on Hillary Clinton at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
Dr. Ben Carson:
But the fact of the matter is, she is the epitome of the progressive &#8211; the secular progressive movement. 
And she counts on the fact that people are uninformed. The Zelinksy Model, taking advantage of useful idiots.  
Well, I just happen to believe that people are not stupid. And the way I will come at it is to educate people, help people to actually understand that it’s that progressive movement that is causing them the problems. 
You know, you look at the national debt, and how it’s being driven up. 
If I was trying to destroy this country, what I would do is find a way to drive wedges between all the people, drive the debt to an unsustainable level, and then step off the stage as a world leader and then let our enemies increase while we decrease our capacities as a military person, and that’s what she’s doing.
