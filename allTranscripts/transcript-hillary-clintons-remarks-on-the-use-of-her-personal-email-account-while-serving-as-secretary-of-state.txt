Question: 
And what do you think about this Republican idea of having an independent third party come in and examine your emails? 
Hillary Clinton: 
So even if you have a work-related device with a work-related .gov account, you choose what goes on that. That’s the way our system works. 
And so we trust and count on the judgment of thousands &#8211; maybe millions &#8211; of people to make those decisions, and I feel that I did that and even more &#8211; that I went above and beyond what I was requested to do. And again, those will be out in the public domain and people will be able to judge for themselves. 
Question: 
Why did you not do that? Why did you not go along with State Department rules until two years after you left office? 
And also, the President of the United States said he was unaware that you had this unusual email arrangement. The White House Counsel’s office says that you never approved this arrangement through them. Why did you not do that? Why do you apparently caught the White House by surprise? 
…Does all of this affect your decision in any way on whether or not to run for President?
Hillary Clinton: 
First, the laws and regulations in effect when I was Secretary of State allowed me to use my email for work. That is undisputed. 
Secondly, under the Federal Records Act, records are defined as reported information regardless of its form or characteristics. 
And in meeting the record-keeping obligations, it was my practice to email government officials on their state or other .gov accounts so that the emails were immediately captured and preserved. 
Now, there are different rules governing the White House than there are governing the rest of the executive branch. And in order to address the requirements I was under, I did exactly what I have said. I emailed two people and I not only knew &#8211; I expected that then to be captured in the State Department or any other government agency that I was emailing to at a .gov account. 
What happened in late summer, early fall is that the State Department sent a letter to former Secretaries of State, not just me, asking for some assistance in providing any work-related emails that might be on the personal email. 
And what I did was to direct, you know, my counsel to conduct a thorough investigation and to err on the side of providing anything that could be connected to work. They did that. That was my obligation. I fully fulfilled it and then I took the unprecedented step of saying, “Go ahead and release them and let people see them.”
