&#8230;The consensus was there needs to be much more support for local governments to be able to do their jobs in concert with the border patrol.
50% plus of all the apprehensions crossing our border from Brownsville to San Diego, it happened here in Hidalgo County. It&#8217;s pretty amazing.
And having providing support to the local government makes a lot of sense to me.
Secondly, the conversation focused on how do you balance the economic interests of a region like this and border security?
You have to make sure that you do this in a way that doesn&#8217;t make it hard for people&#8217;s livelihoods to continue to prosper and grow. This is a place where a lot of visitors come&#8230;So that was an important point.
And finally, I would suggest that the proposal made by another candidate [Donald Trump] of building a fence based on just the common sense practices that are being applied here doesn&#8217;t work.
You have to have a much deeper strategy than just building a fence.
There has to be much more coordination with local and state law enforcement.
There has to be more focus on a virtual fence, which I&#8217;ve proposed as it relates to GPS technology, drone technologies, other things like that.
The border patrol needs to act on a strategy and stick with it. There&#8217;s too much politicizing of what they&#8217;re trying to do. They do good work but too much influence from Washington, D.C. to be effective.
And the final point that was made is something that&#8217;s really important to understand is that the majority of people crossing the border here are not coming from Mexico.
They&#8217;re coming from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. They&#8217;re part of the northern triangle countries that are &#8211; that have taken advantage of a loophole in the law in effect that was passed a few years ago.
And I think that creating a healthy deterrent effect to be able to make sure that these particularly young kids don&#8217;t cross all the way through Mexico to come to be processed into our country is just completely inappropriate. There are examples of doing it the right way where you create a healthy deterrent effect where people&#8217;s lives aren&#8217;t in jeopardy.
So I learned a lot, and it validates my belief that we need to have a comprehensive strategy to deal with border security unique to the circumstances of each part of the region that is impacted by this.

Question: 
Jeb Bush: 
So we&#8217;re not going to get into the issues of what he said and I said.
The simple fact is that his proposal is unrealistic. It will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. It will violate people&#8217;s civil liberties. It will create friction with our third largest trading partner that&#8217;s not necessary. And I think he&#8217;s wrong about this.
If folks interested in a more comprehensive approach, you might want to read my book &#8211; &#8220;Immigration Wars&#8221; &#8211; which I published four years.
I welcome Mr. Trump into the debate. I think that&#8217;s great. He&#8217;s a serious candidate and he ought to be held to what serious candidates need to be held to &#8211; he needs to be held to account for his views.
Question: 
Jeb Bush: 
So, I&#8217;m excited to be here. We&#8217;re going to campaign hard. On March 1st you have the Texas primary. My intention is to win the Texas primary just in case anybody is curious about it.
