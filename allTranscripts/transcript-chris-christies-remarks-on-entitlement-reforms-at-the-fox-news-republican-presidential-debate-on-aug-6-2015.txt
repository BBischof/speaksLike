Partial transcript of remarks by Gov. Chris Christie (R-New Jersey) on entitlement reforms at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
And you say that some of the candidates on this stage are lying. 
Gov. Huckabee says he can save Social Security and Medicare without doing any of that. Is he lying?  
Chris Christie:
Listen, I’m the only guy on this stage that has put out a detailed 12-point plan on entitlement reform and here’s why. Because 71% of federal spending right now is on entitlements and debt service. 71%. 
And we have just spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29% and no time on the 71%. 
And that makes no sense. 
Now, let me tell you exactly what we would do on Social Security. 
Yes, we’d raise the retirement age two years and phase it in over 25 years. That means we raise it one month a year for 25 years when we’re all living longer and living better lives. 
Secondly, we would means test Social Security. 
For those who are making over $200,000 a year in retirement income and who have $4 million to $5 million in liquid assets saved, they don’t need that Social Security check. 
Social Security is meant to be to make sure that no one who’s worked hard and played by the rules and paid into the system grows old in poverty in America. 
If we don’t deal with this problem, it will bankrupt our country or lead to massive tax increases &#8211; neither one that we want in this country.
