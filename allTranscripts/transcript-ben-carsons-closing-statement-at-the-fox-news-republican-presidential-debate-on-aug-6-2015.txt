Partial transcript of closing remarks by Dr. Ben Carson at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Well, I haven&#8217;t said anything about me being the only one to do anything. So, let me try that. 
I&#8217;m the only one that separates the Siamese twins. The only one that operate on babies while they&#8217;re still in the mother&#8217;s womb. The only one to take out half of a brain although you would think if you go to Washington that someone had beaten me to it. 
But I&#8217;m very hopeful that I&#8217;m not the only one who&#8217;s willing to pick up the baton of freedom because freedom is not free and we must fight for it everyday. 
Every one of us must fight for it because we&#8217;re fighting for our children and the next generation.
