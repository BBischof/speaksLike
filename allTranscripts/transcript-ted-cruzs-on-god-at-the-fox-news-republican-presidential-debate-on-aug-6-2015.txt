Partial transcript of remarks by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on God at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
Ted Cruz:
I’m the son of a pastor and an evangelist. 
And I’ve described many times how my father when I was a child was an alcoholic. He wasn’t a Christian. And my father left my mother and left me when I was just three years old. 
And someone invited him to Clay Road Baptist Church, and he gave his heart to Jesus and it turned him around. And he got on a plane and he flew back to my mother and me. 
I would also note that the scripture tells us, you shall know them by their fruits. 
We see lots of campaign conservatives. But if we’re going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative &#8211; someone who’s been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, and national security conservatives. 
There are real difference among the candidates on issues like amnesty, like Obamacare, like religious liberty, like life and marriage. 
And I have been proud to fight and stand for religious liberty, to stand against Planned Parenthood, to defend life for my entire career and I would be proud to continue to do so as President of the United States.
