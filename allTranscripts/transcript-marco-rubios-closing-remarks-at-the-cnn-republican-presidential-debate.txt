One of the things that made Ronald Reagan a great President is that he understood that America was a unique nation.
Unlike any other that have existed throughout human history, he knew it was founded on universal principles that were powerful &#8211; the dignity of all people, human rights, the rights of all to live in freedom and liberty and to choose their own path in life.
He didn’t just believe it. He acted on it.
That’s why bringing down Communism was so important to him.
If I’m honored with the opportunity to be President, I hope our Air Force One will fly first and foremost to our allies in Israel and South Korea and Japan. They’d know we stand with them, that America can be counted on.
It would also fly to China, not just to meet with our enemies, not just to meet with those adversaries of ours that are there but also to meet with those that aspire to freedom and liberty within China. I would even invite them to our inauguration.
We would also fly into Moscow and into Russia and not just meet with the leaders of Russia but also meet with those who aspire to freedom and liberty in Russia.
And ultimately, I hope my Air Force One if I’ll become President will one day land in a free Cuba where its people can choose their leaders and its own destiny.
