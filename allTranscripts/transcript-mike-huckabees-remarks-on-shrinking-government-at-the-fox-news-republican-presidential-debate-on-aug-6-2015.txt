Partial transcript of remarks by former Gov. Mike Huckabee (R-Arkansas) on reducing the size of the federal government at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015:  
Question:
Now, broadly, the size of government is a big concern…But year after year, decade after decade, there are promises from Republicans to shrink government. But year after year, decade after decade, it doesn’t happen. In fact, it gets bigger even under Republican politicians. 
So the question is at this point is the government simply too big for any one person, even a Republican, to shrink?  
Gov. Mike Huckabee (R-Arkansas):
The donor class feeds the political class who does the dance that the donor class wants. And result is the federal government keeps getting bigger. 
Every person on this stage who has been a governor will tell you that the biggest fitting they had was not the other party or even the legislature. It was the federal government who continually put mandates on the states that we had to suck up and pay for it. 
And the fact is there are a lot of things that are happening at the federal level that are absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the constitution. 
This is power that should be shifted back to the states, whether it’s the EPA. 
There is no role at the federal level for the Department of Education. 
And I’m still one who says we can get rid of the Internal Revenue Service if we would pass the fair tax, which is a tax on consumption rather than a tax on people’s income, and move power back where the founders believed it should have been all along.
