…This is really about the survival of western civilization. This is not just a little conflict with a Middle Eastern country that we’ve just now given over $100 billion to. The equivalent in U.S. terms is $5 trillion. 
This threatens Israel immediately. This threatens the entire Middle East. 
But it threatens the United States of America and we can’t treat a nuclear Iranian government as if it is just some government that would like to have some power. 
This is a government that for 36 years has killed Americans. They kidnapped Americans. They’ve named Americans. They have sponsored terrorist groups &#8211; Hamas and Hezbollah. And they’ve threatened the very essence of western civilization. 
To give them this agreement that the President treats like the Magna Carta but the Iranians treat it like it’s toilet paper. And we must simply make it very clear that the next President &#8211; one of us on this stage &#8211; will absolutely not honor that agreement and will destroy it and will be tough with Iran because otherwise we put every person in this world in a very dangerous place.
