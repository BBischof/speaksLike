A second opinion?
One of the greatest medical discoveries of all time were the vaccines, particularly for small pox. And if you want to read a story, it’s called “The Speckled Monsters”. It’s an amazing story. It was all done voluntarily.
But people came in by the droves.
George Washington wouldn’t let his wife visit until she got vaccinated.
So I’m all for vaccines. But I’m also for freedom.
I’m also a little concerned about how they’re bunched up. My kids have all of their vaccines and even if the science doesn’t say bunching up is the problem I ought to have the right to spread my vaccines out a little bit at the very least.
