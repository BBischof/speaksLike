I very much hope that I’m the only person on this stage who can say this but I know there are millions of Americans out there who will say the same thing.
My husband, Frank, and I buried a child to drug addiction.
So we must invest more in the treatment of drugs.
I agree with Sen. Paul. I agree with states’ rights.
But we are misleading young people when we tell them that marijuana is just like having beer. It’s not.
And the marijuana that kids are smoking today is not the same as the marijuana that Jeb Bush smoked 40 years ago. [Laughter]
We do &#8211; sorry &#8211; we do need criminal justice reform. We have the highest incarceration rates in the world.
Two-thirds of the people in our prisons are there for non-violent offenses, mostly drug-related. It’s clearly not working.
But we need to tell young people the truth.
Drug addiction is an epidemic and it is taking too many of our young people. I know this sadly from personal experience.
