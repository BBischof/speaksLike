Partial transcript of remarks by former Gov. Mike Huckabee (R-Arkansas) on abortion at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
Millions of people in this country agree with you. But according to the polls &#8211; again, this is an electability question &#8211; according to the polls, more people don’t. 
So, how do you persuade enough independents and Democrats to get elected in 2016. 
Mike Huckabee:
I’ve actually taken a position that’s bolder than that. 
A lot of people are talking about defunding Planned Parenthood, as if that’s a huge game-changer. 
I think it’s time to do something even more bold. 
I think the next President ought to invoke the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother’s womb is a person at the moment of conception. 
The reason we know that it is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on. 
And this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child’s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law. 
It’s time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being and we change the policy to be pro-life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like they’re parts to a Buick.
