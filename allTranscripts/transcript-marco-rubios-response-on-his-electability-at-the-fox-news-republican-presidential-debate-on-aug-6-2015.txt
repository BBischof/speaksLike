Question:
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida):
I would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition. It’s important to be qualified. But if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton is going to be the next President because she has been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight.
Here’s what this election better be about: This election better be about the future, not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced.
This country is facing an economy that had been radically transformed.
You know the largest retailer in the country, in the world today &#8211; Amazon &#8211; doesn’t even own a single store, and these changes have been disruptive. They have changed people’s lives. The jobs that once sustained our middle class &#8211; they either don’t enough or they are gone.
And we need someone that understands that as our nominee.
If I’m our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton going to lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck.
How is she going to lecture me about student loans? I owed over $100,000 just four years ago.
If I’m our nominee, we will be the party of the future.
