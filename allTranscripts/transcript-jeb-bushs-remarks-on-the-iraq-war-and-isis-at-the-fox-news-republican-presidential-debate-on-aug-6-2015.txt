Partial transcript of remarks by former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Florida) on the Iraq war and ISIS at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
To the families of those who died in that war, who say they liberated a country and deposed a ruthless dictator, how do you look at them now and say your brother’s war was a mistake? 
Jeb Bush:
Knowing what we know now with faulty intelligence and not having security be the first priority when we invaded, it was a mistake. I wouldn’t have gone in. 
However, for the people that did lose their lives and the families that suffer because of it, I know this full well because as the governor of the state of Florida I called every one of them &#8211; every one of them that I could find to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them, and it was very hard to do. 
And every one of them said that their child did not die in vain or that their wife or husband did not die in vain. 
And so while it was difficult for me to do it, it was based on that. 
Here’s the lesson that we should take from this, which relates to this whole subject. Barack Obama became President and he abandoned Iraq. He left and when he left, Al Qaeda was done for, ISIS was created because of the void that we left. And that void exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana. 
To honor the people that died, we need to stop the Iran agreement for sure because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands and we need to take out ISIS with every tool in our disposal.
