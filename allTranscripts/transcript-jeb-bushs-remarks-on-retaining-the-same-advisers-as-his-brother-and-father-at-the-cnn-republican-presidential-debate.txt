…If you are looking at Republican advisers, you have to go to the last two administrations that happened to be 41 and 43. 
So just by definition, if you’re &#8211; and many of the people here that are seeking advice from the foreign policy experts in the Republican side, they’ve served in my dad’s administration, my brother’s administration. Of course that’s the case. 
But I’m my own man. I’m going to create a strategy that’s based on the simple fact that the United States needs to lead the world. 
The first thing that we need to do is to stop the craziness of the sequester, rebuild our military so that we don’t deploy people over and over again without the necessary equipment to keep them safe, to send signal to the world that we’re serious. 
If we’re going to lead the world then we need to have the strongest military possible. 
We need to rebuild our counter intelligence and intelligence capabilities. 
We need to focus on the fact that the next President is going to start in 2017 not in 1990 you know 30 years ago or when my brother started. The world is dramatically different. 
And I believe that we need to restore America’s presence and leadership in the world. 
Name a country where our relationship is better today than it was the day Barack Obama was elected President. 
Under Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, we have seen a weakness that now creates huge problems for the next President of the United States. 
So I’ll have a team that will be following the doctrine that I set up that will be peace through strength. 
We’re sitting here in this library which is a wonderful place to talk about this because that’s exactly what happened in the 1980s and the world was a lot safer because of the leadership of Ronald Reagan.
