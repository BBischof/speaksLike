Question: 
Hillary Clinton: 
And in the overview that I gave of my proposal, I said that we need trade but we need trade that meets the three criteria that I&#8217;ve laid out. That it protects American jobs, it grows the economy, and it also advances our national security. 
And that&#8217;s why I am focused on looking for how we make trade work better for all aspects of our economy. But I am well aware of how critical trade is for American agriculture, and I&#8217;m going to do everything I can as President to make sure &#8211; regardless of what trade agreements we have &#8211; that American farmers get a really good shot at new markets and new opportunities. 
And I think we&#8217;ll have some ways of doing that. And in my longer description of these policies that I overviewed today, you can see more about what I mean.
