Lady Liberty stands tall and strong. She is clear-eyed and resolute. She doesn’t shield her eyes from the realities of the world. But she faces outward into the world nevertheless as we always must. And she holds her torch high because she knows she is a beacon of hope in a very troubled world.
And Lady Justice. Lady Justice holds a sword by her side because she is a fighter, a warrior for the values and the principles that have made this nation great. She holds a scale in her other hand. And with that scale, she says “All of us are equal in the eyes of God, and so all of us must be equal in the eyes of the law and the government &#8211; powerful and powerless alike”. And she wears a blindfold and with that blindfold she is saying to us that it must be true, it can be true, that in this country, in this century, it doesn’t matter who you are, it doesn’t matter what you look like, it doesn’t matter how you start, it doesn’t matter your circumstances, here in this nation every American’s life must be filled with the possibilities that come from their God-given gifts.
One nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
