Well, I hate to say it but Donald Trump has a bit of a point here. 
The case that was decided around 1900 was people had a green card, were here legally and they said that their children were citizens. 
There’s never been a direct Supreme Court case on people who were here illegally whether or not their kids are citizens. 
So it hasn’t really been completely adjudicated. 
The 14th Amendment says that those who are here and under the jurisdiction. The original author of the 14th Amendment said on the Senate floor that this was applying to slaves and did not specifically apply to others.
