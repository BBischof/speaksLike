I would almost say leave it up to them. But I would be willing to check it off and say I will not get Social Security…
As a policy, I would almost leave it up to the people. Don’t forget, they pay in and they pay in and maybe do well and maybe some people want it.
But the fact is that there are people that truly don’t need it and there are many people that do need it very, very badly. And I would be willing to write mine off 100%.
