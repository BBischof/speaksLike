I’m Jeb Bush, and I believe America is on the verge of its greatest century and I’m ready to lead. 
I’m a committed conservative reformer that cut taxes, that balance budgets, that took on the special interests in Florida and we won. 
I look forward to talking tonight about how we can fix a broken Washington D.C. and create an environment where people can rise up again in this great country. 
Thank you.
