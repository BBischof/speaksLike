…I have put forward a plan &#8211; and I’m the only candidate I believe in either party to do this &#8211; to move America forward to a 100% clean electric grid by 2050. 
We did not land a man on the moon with an all-of-the-above strategy. It was an intentional engineering challenge and we solved it as a nation. And our nation must solve this one. 
So I put forward the plan that would extend the investor tax credits for solar and for wind. 
If you go across Iowa, you’d see that 30% of their energy now comes from wind. 
We’re here in Las Vegas &#8211; one of the most sustainable cities in America doing important things in terms of green building, architecture and design. 
We can get there as a nation but it’s going to require presidential leadership and as President, I intend to sign as my very first order in office an order that moves us as a nation and dedicates our resources to solving this problem and moving us to a 100% clean electric grid by 2050.
