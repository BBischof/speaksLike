I’m glad we’re having a discussion about taxes because everybody laments that we lose jobs overseas. We have. Our companies and our jobs are being chased overseas by a 70,000 page tax code. 
So that’s why I’ve chosen to get rid of the whole thing and have one single rate &#8211; 14.5% for everybody &#8211; business and for corporate income and personal income. And we also get rid of the payroll tax so the working class will get a tax break as well. 
So I think a flat tax, eliminating the tax code, getting rid of all the loopholes is the way to go. It’s the way we get America going again.
