Partial transcript of remarks by former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Florida) on Common Core at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
A lot of people on this stage vigorously oppose federal involvement in education. They say it should all be handled locally. 
President Obama’s Secretary of Education &#8211; Arne Duncan &#8211; has has that most of the criticisms of Common Core is due to a “fringe group of critics”. Do you think that’s accurate? 
Jeb Bush:
I’m for higher standards measured in intellectually honest ways with abundant school choice, ending social promotion. 
And I know how to do this because as governor of the state of Florida, I created the first statewide voucher program in the country, the second statewide voucher program in the country, and the third statewide voucher program in the country. 
And we had rising student achievement across the board, because high standards, robust accountability, ending social promotions in third grade, real school choice across the board, challenging the teacher’s union and beating them is the way to go. 
And Florida’s low-income kids had the greatest gains inside the country. Our graduation rate improved by 50%. That’s what I’m for.
