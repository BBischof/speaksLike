…I think what you’ve heard up here is some of the old thinking on immigration reform and it’s why it’s gridlocked. 
We need to understand that our country’s made stronger in every generation by the arrival of new American immigrants. 
That is why I’ve put out a policy for comprehensive immigration reform. That is why I would go further than President Obama on DACA [Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals] and DAPA [Deferred Action for Parents of Americans]. 
I mean, we are a nation of immigrants. We are made stronger by immigrants. 
Do you think for a second that simply because somebody standing in a broken queue on naturalization they’re not going to go to the hospital and that care isn’t going to fall onto our insurance rates? 
I am for a generous, compassionate America that says we’re all in this together. 
We need comprehensive immigration reform. It will make wages go up in America…[overlapping audio]
