Partial transcript of remarks by former Gov. Mike Huckabee (R-Arkansas) on transgender individuals in the military at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
And now, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently directed the military to prepare for a moment when it is welcoming transgendered persons to serve openly.
As commander-in-chief, how would you handle that?
Mike Huckabee:
It’s not to transform the culture by trying out some ideas that some people think would make us a different country and more diverse.
The purpose is to protect America.
I’m not sure how paying for transgendered surgery for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines makes our country safer.
We’ve reduced the military by 25% under President Obama.
The disaster is that we’ve forgotten why we have a military.
The purpose of it is to make sure that we protect every American wherever that American is.
And if an American is calling out for help whether it’s in Benghazi or at the border then we ought to be able to answer it.
We’ve not done that because we decimated our military.
We’re flying B-52s &#8211; most recent &#8211; and the fact is most of them are older than me and that’s pretty scary.
