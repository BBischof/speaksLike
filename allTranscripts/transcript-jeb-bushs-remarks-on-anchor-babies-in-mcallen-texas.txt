Question: 
Jeb Bush: 
What I was talking about was the specific case of fraud being committed where there&#8217;s organized efforts and frankly it&#8217;s more related to Asian people coming into our country, having children in that organized efforts, taking advantage of a noble concept, which is birthright citizenship. 
I support the 14th Amendment. 
Nothing about what I&#8217;ve said should be viewed as derogatory towards immigrants at all. 
This is all how politics play. 
And by the way, I think we need to take a step back and chill out a little bit as it relates to the political correctness, that somehow you have to be scolded every time you say something. 
It&#8217;s not fair to be taken out of context. That&#8217;s the nature of politics. But I just don&#8217;t think that this is appropriate. 
Question: 
Jeb Bush: 
And that&#8217;s what we need to do. We need to enforce the law. 
We need to create a more secure border, not just at the border, but across the spectrum. 
I mean, there are 40% of the people that come here that are here illegally today came with a legal visa. Enforcing the immigration laws of our country needs to be a high priority. 
&#8230;How you do it? You put more resources &#8211;
