Question:
But there are several opponents on this stage who get big applauses in early voting states with this line: “The last thing the country needs is another Bush in the Oval Office.”
So, do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics?
Jeb Bush:
Maybe the barrier &#8211; the bar’s even higher for me. That’s fine.
I’ve got a record in Florida. I’m proud of my dad and I’m certainly proud of my brother.
In Florida, they call me Jeb because I earned it.
I cut taxes every year totaling $19 billion.
We balanced every budget. We went from $1 billion of reserves to $9 billion of reserves.
We were one of two states that went to AAA bond rating.
They call me Veto Corleone because I vetoed 2,500 separate line items in the budget.
I’m my own man. I govern as a conservative and I govern effectively.
And the net effect was during my eight years, 1.3 million jobs were created. We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way and people rose up.
