Hillary Clinton: 
I remember coming here when you were governor and talking to you &#8211; you actually talking to me about wind power and showing me some of the very first windmills that were going up and how you had focused the state government and the businesses of Iowa to really see the economic opportunities as well as the clean renewable energy. 
Leadership matters, and leadership that produces results and leadership that has the vision and then follow-through to realize that vision. 
And it&#8217;s a great personal pleasure for me to be here with Tom but it&#8217;s also a professional one because of the leadership that he provided on the issues that I was talking about in my rural agenda. 
So, again, thank you very much, Tom.

Question: 
Tom Vilsack: 
It&#8217;s a very personal decision and it&#8217;s one that I didn&#8217;t hesitate to make in 2008 and I don&#8217;t hesitate to make it today. 
I know what kind of person she is. I know what kind of leader she would be. And I&#8217;m confident she would be an incredible President. 
I love Joe Biden, just like we all do. He&#8217;s a wonderful man. And everything Hillary Clinton just said about Joe Biden I would echo. 
You know, this business &#8211; you know, they call them campaigns for a reason. They&#8217;re tough. They&#8217;re hard. Choices are difficult. 
But our friends and neighbors here in Iowa need to know, I think, where I stand, where Christie stands, and we firmly stand behind Hillary and we will &#8217;til the last dog dies.
