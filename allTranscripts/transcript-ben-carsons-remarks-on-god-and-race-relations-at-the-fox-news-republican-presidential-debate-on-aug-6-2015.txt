Partial transcript of remarks by Dr. Ben Carson on God and race relations at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question on God and race relations: 
Dr. Ben Carson:
You know, we have the purveyors of hatred who&#8217;d take every single incident between people of two races and try to make a race war out of it and drive wedges into people. And this does not need to be done. 
What we need to think about instead &#8211; you know, I was asked by an NPR reporter once why don&#8217;t I talk about race that often. I said it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a neurosurgeon. And she thought that was a strange response. 
And I said, &#8220;You see, when I take someone to the operating room, I&#8217;m actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are. The skin doesn&#8217;t make them who they are. The hair doesn&#8217;t make them who they are.&#8221;
And it&#8217;s time for us to move beyond that because, you know, our strength as a nation comes in our unity. We are the United States of America, not the divided states. 
And those who are trying to destroy us or try to divide us, we shouldn&#8217;t let them do it.
