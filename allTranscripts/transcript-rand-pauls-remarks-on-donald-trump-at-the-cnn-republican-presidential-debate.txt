I kind of have to laugh when I think of “Hmmm…sounds like a non-sequitur.” 
He was asked whether or not he would be capable and he would be in good hands to be in charge of nuclear weapons and all of a sudden there’s a sideways attack at me. 
I think that really goes to really the judgment. 
Do we want someone with that kind of character, that kind of careless language to be negotiating with Putin? 
Do we want someone like that to be negotiating with Iran? 
I think really there’s a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about Mr. Trump. 
But I am worried. I’m very concerned about having him in charge of the nuclear weapons because I think his response, his visceral response to attacking people on their appearance &#8211; short, tall, fat, ugly &#8211; my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that? 
Would we not all be worried to have someone like that in charge of the nuclear arsenal?
