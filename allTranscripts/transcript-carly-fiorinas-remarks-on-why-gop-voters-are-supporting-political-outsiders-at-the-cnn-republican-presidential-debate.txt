I’ll tell you why people are supporting outsiders. It’s because you know what happens when someone’s been in the system their whole life, they don’t know how broken the system is. 
A fish swims in water; it doesn’t know it’s water. 
It’s not that politicians are bad people; it’s that they’ve been in that system forever. 
The truth is that 75% of the American people think the government is corrupt. 
82% of the American people think these problems that have festered for 50 years in some cases, 25 years in other cases &#8211; the border’s been insecure for 25 years, 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care &#8211; these things have gone on for so long because no one will challenge the status quo. 
You know what a leader does? They challenge the status quo. They solve problems that have festered for a long time. And they produce results. 
That’s what my whole life has been about. People know this is about far more than replacing a D with an R. This is about changing the system.
