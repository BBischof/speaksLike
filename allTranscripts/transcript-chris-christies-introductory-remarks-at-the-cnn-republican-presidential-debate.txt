Hi. My name is Chris Christie. 
And I’d like you to take the camera off me and put it on the audience because I’d like to ask all of you &#8211; how many of you &#8211; raise your hand &#8211; believe that in today’s Barack Obama’s America your children will have a better life than you’ve had? 
You see? That’s why I’m running for President. 
Because leadership is not about me; it’s about our country. 
And what we talk about tonight, it’s not about us; it’s about the people in the audience tonight because in seven short years this President has stripped away their trust and their faith and their belief that their next generation will have a better life. 
He’s stolen that from us and when I’m President, I’m going to take it back.
