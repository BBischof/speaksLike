I can tell you this &#8211; we didn’t surrender in New Jersey. 
Six years ago as the brand new first ever pro-life governor of New Jersey since Roe v. Wade, I defunded Planned Parenthood and I vetoed Planned Parenthood funding now eight times in New Jersey. 
Since the day I walked in as governor, Planned Parenthood has not been funded in New Jersey. We stood up and every one of those vetoes has been sustained. 
But here’s the problem. We’re fighting with each other up here. We agree. 
Let’s ask Hillary Clinton. She believes in the systematic murder of children in the womb to preserve their body parts in a way that maximizes their value for sale for profit. 
It is disgusting and the American people need to hear it. We shouldn’t be fighting with each other. She’s the real opponent. She’s the real problem. 
I’ll tell you what I would be willing to fight for…Why don’t we put tax reform on the President’s desk so we could simplify the tax system &#8211; [overlapping audio]
…We’ve got to talk about what we would be willing to shut down for. Why don’t we put tax reform on this President’s desk and make him veto it if that’s what he wants to do. 
Why haven’t we repealed and replaced Obamacare? 
We should be doing these things and forcing the President to take action. Let’s force him to do what he says he’s going to do. 
Now, I don’t know whether he’ll do it or not but let’s force him to do it.
