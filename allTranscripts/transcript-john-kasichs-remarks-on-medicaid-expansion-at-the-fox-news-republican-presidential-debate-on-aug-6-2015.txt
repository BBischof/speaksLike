Question:
You defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God, saying to skeptics that when they arrive in heaven, Saint Peter isn’t going to ask them how small they’ve kept government but what they have done for the poor. 
Why should Republican voters who generally want to shrink government believe you won’t use your Saint Peter rationale to expand every government program?  
John Kasich:
Secondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio &#8211; to do what? To treat the mentally ill. 10,000 of them sit in our prisons. It costs $22,500 a year to keep them in prison. I’d rather get them their medications so they could lead a decent life. 
Secondly, we’re rehabbing the drug addicted. 80% of the people in our prisons have addiction problems. We now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community, and the recidivism rate is 10%. And everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is threatening their very family. So we’re treating them and getting them on their feet. 
And finally, the working poor &#8211; instead of having them come into the emergency rooms where it costs more, where they’re sicker and we end up paying, we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet. 
And you know what? Everybody has a right to their God-given purpose. 
And finally, our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country. 
And finally, we went from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black. We’ve cut $5 billion in taxes and we’ve grown 350,000 jobs.
