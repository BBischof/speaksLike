Well, actually, you know, we had this conversation, and I will tell &#8211; I will share with you that I’ve traveled all around the country and there’s two phrases that I keep hearing again and again and again. And they’re the phrases “new leadership” and “getting things done”. 
We cannot be this dissatisfied with our gridlocked national politics and an economy where 70% of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago and think that resort to old names is going to move us forward. 
I respect what Secretary Clinton and her husband have done for our country but our country needs new leadership to move forward. 
Hillary Clinton:
I certainly am not campaigning to become President because my last name is Clinton. I’m campaigning because I think I have the right combination of what the country needs at this point, and I think I can take the fight to the Republicans because we cannot afford a Republican to succeed Barack Obama as President of the United States.
