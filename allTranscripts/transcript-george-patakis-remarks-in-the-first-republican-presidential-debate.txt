[Question on electability]
I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside and I think that is a positive thing.
Yes, I thought about running four years ago. I was ready to lead but I wasn’t ready to run.
But I look at this country today and I look at how divided we are. I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing soundbites but never solving problems.
What I did in New York was bring people together &#8211; an overwhelmingly Democratic state. But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative, sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together. We need to solve problems. We need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam. We need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates. We have to end crony capitalism in Washington where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits and the American people don’t get laws in their interests.
I can do it. And I can do it regardless of what the make-up of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
So we need new leadership. Yes, I will be that new leader.
[Question on ISIS-inspired homegrown terrorists]
…Religious liberty doesn’t include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here. That is not protected free speech. That is not protected religious belief. That is like shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater and that is illegal.
And I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks.
And it’s not just the ones they’ve arrested. Think back to Garland, Texas. But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
We have to shut down their Internet capability. We have to shut down whether or not they are in prisons preaching or in mosques preaching. No radical Islam that is allowed to engage and encouraging violence against Americans. That is not protected speech.
But let me just add one thing about ISIS over there. We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
I was governor of New York on Sept. 11th. I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack. We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
I don’t agree that we’re going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars. What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us over there and then get out.
You know, I have two sons. Both served. One is a Marine officer in Iraq. One is an Army officer in Afghanistan.
I do not want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night. I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.

[Question on whether to accept Medicaid expansion funding under Obamacare]
&#8230;I don&#8217;t think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
But getting back to [the] question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change? The answer is no.
I know this because when I ran for governor of New York, 1 in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare. On welfare. Think about that.
And people said, &#8220;You can&#8217;t win. You can&#8217;t change the culture.&#8221;
But I knew that good people who want to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn&#8217;t work were better.
I changed that. We put in place mandatory workfare but we allowed people to keep health care. We put in place child care &#8211;
&#8230;No, it should be repealed. By the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office, replacing dependency with opportunity.
&#8230;
[Question on the recent Planned Parenthood videos]
My heart has not changed because I&#8217;ve always been appalled by abortion. I&#8217;m a Catholic. I believe life begins at conception.
&#8230;Roe v. Wade has been the law for 42 years and I don&#8217;t think we should continue to try to change it.
But what we can do is defund Planned Parenthood.
And by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and just show a hideous disrespect for life.
What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
You know, Hillary Clinton is always saying how Republicans don&#8217;t follow science? Well, they&#8217;re the ones not listening to the scientists today because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb and at that point it&#8217;s a life that we have the right to protect and I think we should protect.
It is Hillary. It is Biden. It is the others who insist allowing abortion well into the life of a viable infant. That is wrong and that should be stopped.
&#8230;
[Question on the first executive order]
I defeated Mario Cuomo. In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had enacted over the prior 12 years. I would do that to Barack Obama&#8217;s executive orders, but I&#8217;d sign a second one as I did in New York as well &#8211; having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
I signed that executive order. When I left the workforce in New York state had been reduced by over 15%. We can do that in Washington. I will do that in Washington.
&#8230;
[Two words to describe Hillary Clinton]:
Divisive and with no vision. No vision at all.
