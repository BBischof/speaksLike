…I don’t yield to anybody on how to enforce the law. 
I’m the only person on this stage who spent seven years as a United States Attorney after Sept. 11th and I know how to do this. 
The fact is though that for 15,000 people a day to be deported every day for two years is an undertaking that almost none of us could accomplish given the current levels of funding and the current number of law enforcement officers. 
But here’s what we need to do and I think this is where Donald is absolutely right. What we need to do is to secure our border and we need to do it with more than just a wall. 
We need to use electronics. We need to use drones. We need to use FBI, DEA and ATF. 
And yes, we need to take the fingerprint of every person who comes into this country on a visa and when they overstay their visa, we need to tap them on their shoulders and say “You have overstayed your welcome. You’re taking advantage of the American people. It’s time for you to go.” 
If we had that kind of system in place, we wouldn’t have the 11 million people we have now.
