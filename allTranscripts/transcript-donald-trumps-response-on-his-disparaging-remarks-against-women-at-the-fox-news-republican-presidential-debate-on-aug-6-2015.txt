Donald Trump:
Question:
Your Twitter account &#8211; for the record, it was well beyond Rosie O’Donnell. 
Donald Trump:
Question:
You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. 
Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as President? 
And how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who is likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?
Donald Trump:
I’ve been challenged by so many people and I don’t frankly have time for total political correctness. 
And to be honest with you, this country doesn’t have time either. 
This country is in big trouble. We don’t win anymore. We lose to China. We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border. We lose to everybody. 
And frankly what I say and oftentimes it’s fun, it’s kidding. We have a good time. What I say is what I say. 
And honestly, Megan, if you don’t like it, I’m sorry. I’ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be based on the way that you’ve treated me but I wouldn’t do that. 
But you know what? We &#8211; we need strength. We need energy. We need quickness. And we need brain in this country to turn it around. That I can tell you right now.
