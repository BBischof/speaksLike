Well, as President, I will make this nation that will solve problems. And how? By having the elected officials and leaders realize they’re Americans before they’re Republicans or Democrats.
I did it in Washington and I’ve done it in Ohio by having the elected officials realize that they’re Ohioans before anything else.
Secondly, I will rebuild the relationships and show the respect to our allies around the world. We have no choice but to do that.
We will be stronger when we are unified and we’ll fight for freedom and for human rights.
And finally, taking a little bit of what Carly said, the people that are out there listening, America was never great because we ran America from the top down. America is great because we’ve run America from the bottom up, where we all live in the neighborhoods.
One more time in America, we need to revive the concept that citizenship where everybody’s actions make a huge difference in changing the world.
We have a Holocaust Memorial on our State House grounds and there is one line on there that stands out all the time &#8211; “If you’ve saved one life, you’ve changed the world.”
We need to adopt that as citizens and rebuild and re-inspire our country.
Thank you.
