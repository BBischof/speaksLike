Partial transcript of remarks by former Gov. Mike Huckabee (R-Arkansas) on the Iran nuclear deal at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question on the Iran deal:
Mike Huckabee:
President Obama is “Trust but vilify”. He trusts our enemies and vilifies everyone who disagrees with him. 
And the reason we disagree with him has nothing to do with party. It has to do with the incredibly dangerous place that this world is going to be as a result of a deal in which we got nothing. 
We didn’t even get four hostages out. We got nothing. 
And Iran gets everything they want. 
We said we would have anytime, anywhere negotiations and inspections. We gave that up. 
We said that we would make sure that they didn’t have any nuclear capacity. We gave that up. 
The President can’t tell us what we got. 
I’ll tell you what the world got. The world has a burgeoning nuclear power that didn’t &#8211; as the Soviets said we might defend ourselves in a war &#8211; but what the Iranians have said is “We will wipe Israel off the face of a map, and we will bring death to America.” 
When someone points a gun at your head and loads it, by God, you ought to take them seriously, and we need to take that seriously.
