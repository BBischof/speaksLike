Question:
How can you win in 2016 when you’re such a divisive figure? 
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas):
If you’re looking for someone to go to Washington to go along to get along, to agree with the career politicians in both parties, who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests, then I ain’t your guy. 
There is a reason that we have $18 trillion in debt because as conservatives, as Republicans, we keep winning elections. We got a Republican House. We got a Republican Senate. And we don’t have leaders who honor their commitments. 
I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would.
