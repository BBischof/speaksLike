Well, first of all, let’s remember where we were when Bush left office. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month. 
And I know my Republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue. 
But the world’s financial markets were on the verge &#8211; system &#8211; was the verge of collapse. 
That’s where we were. Are we better off today than we were then? Absolutely. 
But the truth is that for the last 40 years, the great middle class in this country has been disappearing. 
And in my view, what we need to do is to create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, pay equity for women workers, end our disastrous trade policies which have cost us millions of jobs and make every public college and university in this country tuition free. 
Well, that’s not true. 
Let us be clear that the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street where fraud is a business model helped to destroy this economy and the lives of millions of people. Check the record. 
In the 1990s and due respect &#8211; in the 1990s when I had the Republican leadership and Wall Street spending billions of dollars in lobbying, when the Clinton administration when Alan Greenspan said “What a great idea it would be to allow these huge banks to merge”, Bernie Sanders fought them and helped lead the opposition to deregulation. 
Today, it is my view that when you have three largest banks in America are much bigger than they were when we bailed them out for being to big to fail, we have got to break them up.
