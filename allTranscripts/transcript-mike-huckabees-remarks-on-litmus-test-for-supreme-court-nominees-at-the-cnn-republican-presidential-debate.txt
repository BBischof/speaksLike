You better believe I will.
Because I’m tired of liberals always having a litmus test and conservatives are supposed to pretend we don’t.
Well, let me tell you what mine would be.
Number one, I’d ask “Do you think that the unborn child is a human being or is it just a blob of tissue?” I’d want to know the answer to that.
I’d want to know “Do you believe in the First Amendment? Do you believe that religious liberty is the fundamental liberty around all the other freedoms of this country are based?”
And I’d want to know “Do you really believe in the Second Amendment? Do you believe that we have an individual right to bear arms, to protect ourselves and our family and to protect our country?”
And do you believe in the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendment? Do you believe that a person before they’re deprived of life and liberty should in fact have due process and equal protection under the law? Because if you do, you’re going to do more than defund Planned Parenthood.
One final thing. I’d make darn sure that we’d absolutely believe in the Tenth Amendment.
Every governor on this stage would share this much with you. Every one of us &#8211; our biggest fight &#8211; wasn’t always with the legislature or even the Democrats.
My gosh, half the time it was the federal government who apparently never understood that if it’s not reserved in the Constitution then the Tenth Amendment says it’s left to the states but somebody forgot to send the memo to Washington.
