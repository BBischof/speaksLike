Partial transcript of remarks by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) on illegal immigration at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
Marco Rubio:
The first is the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They’re coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in…
I also believe we need a fence. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too.
And that’s why you need an E-Verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration.
But I agree with what Gov. Kasich just said. People are frustrated.
This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who will illegally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we’re being taken advantage of.
We feel like despite our generosity we are being taken advantage of.
And let me tell you who never gets about in these debates. The people that call my office who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States and they’ve paid their fees and they hired a lawyer and they can’t get in and they’re wondering maybe they should come illegally.
And so these are important issues and we should address it. It’s a serious problem that needs to be addressed and otherwise we’re going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years like we have for the last 30 years.
