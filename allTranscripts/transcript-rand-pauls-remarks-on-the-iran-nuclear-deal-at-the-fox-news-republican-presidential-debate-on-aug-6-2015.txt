Partial transcript of remarks by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) on the Iranian nuclear deal at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
Rand Paul:
I don’t think that the President negotiated from a position of strength. 
But I don’t immediately discount negotiations. 
I’m a Reagan conservative. Reagan did negotiate with the Soviets. 
But you have to negotiate from a position of strength, and I think President Obama gave away too much too early. 
If there’s going to be a negotiation, you’re going to have to believe somehow that Iranians are going to comply. 
And I asked this question to John Kerry. I said, “Do you believe they’re trustworthy?” He said, “No.” Then I said, “Well, how are we going to get them to comply?”
I would have never released the sanctions before there was consistent evidence of compliance.
