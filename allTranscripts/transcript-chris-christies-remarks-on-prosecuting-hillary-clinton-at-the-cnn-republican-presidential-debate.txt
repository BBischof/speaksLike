…The question is who’s going to prosecute Hillary Clinton? 
The Obama White House seems to have no interest. The Justice Department seems to have no interest. 
I think it’s time to put a former federal prosecutor on the same stage with Hillary Clinton and I will prosecute her during those debates on that stage, for the record, that we’re talking about here. 
The fact that she had a private email server basically using national security secrets running through it. Could have been hacked by the Russians, the Chinese or two 18-year-olds on a tube wanting to have some fun. 
No one’s answering that question from the Hillary Clinton clan. You know why? Because she knows she’s wrong and she cannot look in the mirror at herself and she cannot tell the American people the truth.
