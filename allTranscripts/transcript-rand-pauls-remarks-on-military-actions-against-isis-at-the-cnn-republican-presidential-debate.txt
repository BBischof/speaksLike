There will always be a Bush or Clinton for you if you want to go back to war in Iraq.
But the thing is the first war was a mistake, and I’m not sending our sons and our daughters back to Iraq. The war didn’t work.
We can amplify those who live there. The Kurds deserve to be armed and I’ll arm them.
We can use our air force to amplify the forces there.
But the boots on the ground need to be the people who live there.
My goodness, I’m still upset with the Saudi Arabians for everything they do over there. They’ve funded the arms that went to the jihadists. They’re not accepting any of the people, any of the migrants that have been &#8211; the refugees that have been pushed out of Syria &#8211; Saudi Arabia has not accepting one.
Why are we always the world’s patsies that we have to go over there and fight their wars for them?
They need to fight their wars. We need to defend American interests. But it’s not in America’s national security interest to have another war in Iraq.
