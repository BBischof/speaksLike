Actually, I believe what she said was there was a lot of policies that have led to this unrest. 
Let’s talk about this a little bit. One of the things that was not reported during that heartbreaking night of unrest in Baltimore was that arrests had actually fallen to a 38-year low in the year prior to Freddie Gray’s tragic death. 
…When I ran for mayor of Baltimore back in 1999, it was not because our city was doing well; it was because we had allowed ourselves to become the most violent, addicted, and abandoned city in America. 
And I ran and promised people that together we can turn that around. And we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime…by more than any major city in America over the next 10 years. 
I did not make our city immune to setbacks. And I attended a lot of funerals, including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor African-American neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner. 
We’ve saved over 1,000 lives in Baltimore in the last 15 years with people working together and the vast majority of them were young and poor and black. It wasn’t easy on any day, but we saved lives and we gave our city a better future, improving police and community relations every single day that I was in office. 
I think the key word in your follow-up there was the word “settled”. That’s true. It was settled. 
Arrest peaked in 2003…but they declined every year after that as we restored peace in our poor neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime. 
Look, none of this is easy. None of us have all the answers. But together as a city, we saved a lot of lives. 
It was about leadership. It was about principle. And it was about bringing people together.
