Partial transcript of remarks by Donald Trump on why he’s a Republican at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
You favored an assault weapons ban as well. 
In 2004, you said in most cases you identified as a Democrat. 
Even in this campaign, your critics say you often sound more like a Democrat than a Republican, calling several of your opponents on this stage things like “clowns” and “puppets”. 
When did you actually become a Republican?
Donald Trump:
I’ll tell you what. I’ve evolved on many issues over the years and you know who else has? Ronald Reagan evolved on many issues. 
I am pro-life. And if you look at the question, I was in business. They asked me a question as to pro-life or choice, and I said &#8211; if you let it run &#8211; that I hate the concept of abortion. I hate the concept of abortion. 
And then since then I’ve very much evolved. 
And what happened is friends of mine years ago were going to have a child and it was going to be aborted and it wasn’t aborted and that child today is a total super star &#8211; a great, great child. 
And I saw that and I saw other instances and I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life. 
As far as being a Republican is concerned, I come from a place &#8211; New York City &#8211; which is virtually, I mean, it’s almost exclusively Democrat. 
And I have really started to see some of the negatives &#8211; as an example and I have a lot of liking for this man but the last number of months of his brother’s administration were a catastrophe and unfortunately those few months gave us President Obama and you can’t be happy about that.
