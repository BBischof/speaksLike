Partial transcript of remarks by Donald Trump on Iranian General Qassem Soleimani at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
His trip to Russia appears to directly violate U.N. Security Council resolutions to confine him to Iran. 
…If you were President, how would you respond to this? 
Donald Trump:
We have a President who doesn’t have a clue. I would say he’s incompetent but I don’t want to do that because that’s not nice. 
But if you look at the deals we make whether it’s the nuclear deal with 24 hour periods &#8211; and by the way before you get to the 24 hours, you have to go through a system. 
You look at Sergeant Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl &#8211; a traitor &#8211; and they get five of the big great killers and leaders that they want. 
We have people in Washington that don’t know what they’re doing. 
I agree. 
Now, with Iran. We’re making a deal. You would say we want him, we want him, we want our prisoners. We want all these things. We don’t get anything. We’re giving them $150 billions plus. 
They are going to be &#8211; I’ll tell you what. If Iran was a stock, you folks should go out and buy it right now because you’ll quadruple. 
What’s happened in Iran is a disgrace and it’s going to lead to destruction in large portions of the world.
