Partial transcript of remarks by Donald Trump on illegal immigration at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
Gov. Bush has called those remarks “extraordinarily ugly”. 
I’d like you &#8211; you’re right next to him &#8211; talk to him directly and say how you’d respond to that. 
And you have repeatedly said that you have evidence that the Mexican government is doing this but that you have evidence you have refused or declined to share. 
Why don’t you use this first Republican presidential debate to share your proof with the American people? 
Donald Trump:
This was not a subject that was on anybody’s mind until I brought it up at my announcement and I said Mexico is sending. 
Except the reporters because they’re a very dishonest lot generally speaking in the world of politics, they didn’t cover my statement the way I said it. 
The fact is since then many killings, murders, crimes, drugs pouring across the border, our money going out and the drugs coming in. 
And I said we need to build a wall and it has to be built quickly. And I don’t mind having a big, beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally. 
But we need &#8211; Jeb &#8211; to build a wall. We need to keep illegals out. 
Question:
Donald Trump:
And the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning, and they send the bad ones over because they don’t want to pay for them, they don’t want to take care of them. Why should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them? 
And that’s what’s happening whether you like it or not.
