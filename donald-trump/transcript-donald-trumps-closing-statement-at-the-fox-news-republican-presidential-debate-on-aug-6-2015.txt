Partial transcript of closing remarks by Donald Trump at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Our country is in serious trouble. We don’t win anymore. 
We don’t beat China in trade. 
We don’t beat Japan with their millions and millions of cars coming into this country in trade. 
We can’t beat Mexico at the border or in trade. 
We can’t do anything right. 
Our military has to be strengthened. 
Our vets have to be taken care of. 
We have to end Obamacare.
And we have to make our country great again and I will do that. 
Thank you
