Having met Vladimir Putin, I wouldn’t talk to him at all. We’ve talked way too much to him. 
What I would do immediately is begin rebuilding the Sixth Fleet. I would begin rebuilding the missile defense program in Poland. I would conduct regular aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states. I’d probably send a few thousand more troops into Germany. 
Vladimir Putin would get the message. 
By the way, the reason it is so critically important that every one of us know Gen. Soleimani’s name is because Russia is in Syria right now because the head of the Qud’s force traveled to Russia and talked Vladimir Putin into aligning themselves with Iran and Syria to prop up Bashar al Assad. 
Russia is a bad actor. But Vladimir Putin is someone we should not talk to because the only way he will stop is to sense strength and resolve on the other side and we have all of that within our control. 
We could rebuild the sixth fleet. I will. We haven’t. 
We could rebuild the missile defense program. We haven’t. I will. 
We could also &#8211; to Sen. Rubio’s point &#8211; give the Egyptians what they’ve asked for which is intelligence. We could give the Jordanians what they’ve asked for &#8211; bombs and material &#8211; we have not supplied it; I will. We could arm the Kurds; they’ve been asking us for three years. 
All of this is within our control.
