Partial transcript of former HP CEO Carly Fiorina&#8217;s closing statement in the first Republican presidential debate hosted by Fox News on Aug. 6, 2015:
Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi. She lies about emails. She’s still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party’s frontrunner.
2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism and a Democratic Party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
We need a nominee that’s going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
I’m not a member of the political class. I am a conservative. I can win this job. I can do this job.
I need your help. I need your support.
I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
Thank you.
