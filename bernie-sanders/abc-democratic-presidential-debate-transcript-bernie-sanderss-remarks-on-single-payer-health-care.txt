Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s remarks on   single payer health care at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
Let me say this, as a member of the Health, Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward. 
17 million more people have health care. It is a step forward. 
But, this is what we also have to say. Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can’t afford to go to the doctor &#8211; major crisis in primary health care. 
Here is the bottom line. Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right? 
Why is it that we are &#8211; why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the UK, 50% more than what they pay in France &#8211; countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases have better health care outcomes? 
Bottom line, this slides into campaign finance reform. The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress. 
We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system. It will lower the cost of health care for our middle class family by thousands of dollars a year. 
…They will not be paying…any private insurance. So it’s unfair to say in total…I can tell you that adding up the fact that you are not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance, the average middle class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.
