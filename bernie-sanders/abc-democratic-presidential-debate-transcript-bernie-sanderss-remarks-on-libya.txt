Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s remarks on Libya at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
The Secretary is right. This is a terribly complicated issue. There are no simple solutions. 
But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossadegh in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad, the truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America overthrow a dictator.  
But it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator. 
So I think Secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement. I’m not quite the fan of regime change I believe she is. 
Hillary Clinton: 
Now, I understand that this is very difficult and I’m not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia. 
We saw what happened in Egypt. I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship. 
This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches. One, work with the tough men, the dictators for our own benefit, and promote democracy. That’s a hard road to walk but I think it’s the right road for us to try to travel.
