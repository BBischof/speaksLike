Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s closing statement at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
…Let me applaud my colleagues up here because I think frankly &#8211; maybe I’m wrong &#8211; but on our worst day, I think we have a lot to offer the American people than the right wing extremists. 
My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it’s like to be the son of an immigrant. 
We grew up in a 3.5 room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York. 
My mother’s dream &#8211; and she died very young &#8211; but my mother’s dream for her whole was to be able to get out of that rent-controlled apartment and own a home of her own. She never lived to see that. 
But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college. We were the first in the family. 
So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family that does not have sufficient income. 
And that is why I have pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say “Enough is enough! This great country and our government belong to all of us, not just the handful of billionaires.” 
Thank you very much.
