Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s remarks on  sending ground troops to fight ISIS at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the history of our country. I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage I believe for the second Iraq war. 
And what I believe right now &#8211; and I believe this is terribly important &#8211; is the United States of America cannot succeed or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there is an international crisis all over the world in France or in the UK, “Hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers. They’re going to send the troops. And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years, no problem.” 
…What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition including Russia &#8211; a well-coordinated effort. 
But I agree as I mentioned a moment ago with King Abdullah, this is a war for the soul of Islam. The troops on the ground should not be American troops, they should be Muslim troops. 
I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need and the troops that we need to destroy ISIS with American support. 
My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they &#8211; one of the wealthiest countries on Earth &#8211; are going to have to go to war against ISIS, to tell Qatar that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep.
