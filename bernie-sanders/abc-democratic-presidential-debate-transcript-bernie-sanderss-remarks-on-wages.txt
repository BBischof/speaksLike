Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s remarks on   wages at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy. 
As you’ve indicated, middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing. 
Are we better off today than when Bush left office? Absolutely. 
But as you’ve indicated for millions of American workers &#8211; people in New Hampshire &#8211; all over America, they’re working longer hours for lower wages, deeply worried about their kids. 
So what do we do? 
First statement that we make is we tell the billionaire class they cannot have it all. For a start, they’re going to start paying their fair share of taxes. 
Second of all we do is you raise the minimum wage to a living wage &#8211; $15 an hour over the next several years. 
Next thing we do &#8211; pay equity for women workers. Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. 
Next thing that we do &#8211; real unemployment &#8211; official unemployment 5%, real unemployment 10%, youth unemployment off the charts. 
We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our rail system. We create 13 million jobs with a trillion dollar investment. 
…In a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world. That is why I’m going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
