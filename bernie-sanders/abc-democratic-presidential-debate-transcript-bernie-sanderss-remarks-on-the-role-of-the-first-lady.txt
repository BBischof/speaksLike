[Question on whether Sanders’s wife will have a desk close by his in the West Wing if elected president]
Given the fact that she’s a lot smarter than me, yes, she would. 
And let me by the way take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our First Lady but redefined what that role could be. So I thank you very much for that.
My wife, Jane, has been way back when before I knew her a foster parent. Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed. And she turned around many lives. 
She is the best parent and grandmother that I know. 
She has devoted her life when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office. We started an after school program for kids. Started a child care center. Started a youth newspaper. We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues. She led that effort. 
So I think at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, when too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children to deal with the dysfunctional child care system. And I think my wife will do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
