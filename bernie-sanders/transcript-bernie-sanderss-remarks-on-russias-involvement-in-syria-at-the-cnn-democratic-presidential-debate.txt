Well, let’s understand that when we talk about Syria, you’re talking about a quagmire in a quagmire. 
You’re talking about groups of people trying to overthrow Assad, other groups of people fighting ISIS. 
You’re talking about people fighting ISIS using their guns to overthrow Assad and vice versa. 
I’m the former chairman…of the Senate Veterans Committee. And in that capacity, I learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war. 
And I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq &#8211; the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country. 
We should be putting together a coalition of Arab countries who should be leading the effort. We should be supportive. 
But I do not support American ground troops in Syria. 
Hillary Clinton:
Bernie Sanders:
I think that when he gets into that…Well, I think he’s already regretting what he did in Crimea and what he is doing in the Ukraine. 
I think he’s really regretting the decline of his economy. 
And I think what he is trying to do now is saving some face. But I think when Russians get killed in Syria and when he gets bogged, I think the Russian people are going to give him a message that maybe they should come home, maybe they should start working with the United States to rectify the situation there.
