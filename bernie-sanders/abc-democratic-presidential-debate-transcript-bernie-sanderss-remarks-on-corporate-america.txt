Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s remarks on  corporate America at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
Moderator: 
Bernie Sanders: 
CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary. They ain’t going to like me. 
And Wall Street is going to like me even less. 
And the reason for that is we’ve got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street. 
When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of the four of them are larger today than we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we’ve got to re-establish Glass-Steagall. We have got to break the large financial institutions up. 
Having said that, I don’t think I’m going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street. I don’t have a super PAC. I don’t want campaign contributions from corporate America. 
And let me be clear, while there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view &#8211; and I say this very seriously &#8211; the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and it’s destroying the lives of millions of Americans. 
We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
