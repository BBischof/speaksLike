Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s remarks on gun control and terrorism at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
Look, it’s a country in which people choose to buy guns. I think half of the &#8211; more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont and my guess here in New Hampshire are gun owners. But that’s the right of people. 
But this is what I do believe. I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings not only in San Bernardino and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations. 
For example, talking about polls. Polls recently came out overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check. 
Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or mentally unstable? 
We’ve got to eliminate the gun show loophole. 
In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians. I think there is a consensus. 
I’m not going to say that everybody is in agreement. It’s a divided country on guns. But there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that I coming from a state that has virtually no gun control will do my best to bring together.
