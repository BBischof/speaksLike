Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s remarks on college affordability at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
…I think we have got to work on a two-prong approach and your point is absolutely well-taken. 
The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation. There are a lot of factors involved in that and that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and giant football stadiums. Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members. 
But &#8211; and I understand that in many universities there are a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary. 
But bottom line is this is the year 2015. If we are going to be competitive in the global economy, we need the best educated workforce. 
It is insane to my mind hundreds of thousands of young people today &#8211; bright qualified people cannot go to college because their families cannot afford to send them. 
Millions coming out of schools, as you’ve indicated, deeply in debt. 
What do we do? 
My proposal is to put a speculation tax on Wall Street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition free but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt. 
You have families out there paying 6%, 8%, 10% on student debt, refinance their homes at 3%. What sense is that? 
So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education. We should look at college today the high school was looked at 60 years ago. All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
