Bernie Sanders: 
You know, if somebody’s loading guns and ammunitions into a house, I think it’s a good idea to call 911. Do it. 
I want to talk about something else because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points. 
What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history. 
The secretary is right. Our people are fearful. They are anxious on a number of levels. They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack in America. We all understand that. 
But you know what else they’re anxious about. They are anxious about the fact that they’re working incredibly long hours. They’re worried about their kids and they’re seeing all the new income and wealth &#8211; virtually all of it &#8211; going to the top 1%. 
And they’re looking around them and they’re looking at Washington and they’re saying, “The rich are getting much richer. I’m getting poorer. What are you going to do about it? What are you going to do for my kids?” 
And someday like a Trump comes along and says, “I know the answers. The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they’re criminals and rapists. We’ve got to hate the Mexicans. Those are your enemies. We hate all of the Muslims because all of the Muslims are terrorists.” 
Meanwhile the rich gets richer. 
So what I’d say to those people who go to Donald Trump’s rallies. Understand that he thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea. He thinks low wages are a good idea. 
I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from. Let’s create an America that works for all of us not the handful on top.
