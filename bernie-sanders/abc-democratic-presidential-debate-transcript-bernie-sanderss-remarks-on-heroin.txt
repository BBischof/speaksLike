Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s remarks on heroin at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
It is a tragedy for New Hampshire. It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont. It is a tragedy all over this country. 
The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly. 
What do we do? Well, for a start, it may seem like a radical idea but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together. We cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin. 
Second of all and the reason that I believe in a health care for all program &#8211; we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity, and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues. 
When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help. They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for those. 
So those are some of the areas that I think we’ve got to move on.
