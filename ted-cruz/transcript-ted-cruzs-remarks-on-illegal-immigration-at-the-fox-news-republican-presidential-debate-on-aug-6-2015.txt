Partial transcript of remarks by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on illegal immigration at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question on whether or not Cruz will support the “Kate Steinle’s Law”, which would impose a mandatory five-year prison term for an illegal who’s deported and then returns to this country and defund sanctuary cities? 
Ted Cruz:
And not only will I support it, I have authored Kate’s law in the United States Senate and filed that legislation. 
I tried to get the Senate to vote to pass Kate’s law on the floor of the Senate just one week ago and the leader of our own party blocked a vote on Kate’s law. 
You know, there was reference made to our leaders being stupid. It’s not a question of stupidity. It’s that they don’t want to enforce the immigration laws, that there are far too many in the Washington cartel that support amnesty. 
President Obama’s talked about fundamentally transforming this country. There’s seven billion people across the face of the globe, many of whom want to come to this country. If they come legally, great. But if they come illegally and they get amnesty, that is how we fundamentally change this country. 
And it really is striking. A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty. I have never supported amnesty and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer’s Gang of Eight amnesty legislation in the Senate.
