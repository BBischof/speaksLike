Partial transcript of remarks by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on cyber warfare at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
This comes in the wake of the Director of National Intelligence blaming the Chinese for the largest ever cyber attack, stealing the personal data of tens of millions of Americans. 
…In your view, have Russia and China committed acts of cyber war? And if you were President, what would you do about it? 
Ted Cruz:
Leading from behind is a disaster. We have abandoned and alienated our friends and allies. 
And our enemies are stronger. 
Radical Islam is on the rise. 
Iran’s on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon. 
China is waging cyber warfare against America. 
Russia &#8211; General Soleimani &#8211; you just mentioned &#8211; the Iranian general as the head of the Al Quds forces. He’s directly responsible for the murder of over 500 American servicemen in Iraq and part of this Iranian deal was lifting the international sanctions on General Soleimani. 
The day General Soleimani flew back from Moscow to Iran was the day we believe that Russia used cyber warfare against the joint chiefs. 
We need a new commander-in-chief that will stand up to our enemies and that will have credibility. 
It is worth emphasizing that Iran released our our hostages in 1981, the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.
