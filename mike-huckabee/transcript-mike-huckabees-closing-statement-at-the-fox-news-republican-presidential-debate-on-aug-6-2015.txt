Partial transcript of closing remarks by former Gov. Mike Huckabee (R-Arkansas) at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
It seems like this election has been a whole lot about a person who is very high in the polls but doesn&#8217;t have a clue about how to govern. 
A person who has been filled with scandals and who could not lead. 
And of course, I&#8217;m talking about Hillary Clinton. 
I think America is in trouble but it&#8217;s not beyond repair.
But it&#8217;s going to take leadership who sees the greatness of this country and who believes that once again we can be one nation under God. 
I&#8217;ll be my best to do that. And thank you for your support.
