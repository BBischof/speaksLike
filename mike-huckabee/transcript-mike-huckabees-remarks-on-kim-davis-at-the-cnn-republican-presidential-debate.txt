No, I don’t think [Jeb Bush] is on the wrong side of such an issue. Jeb is a friend. I’m not up here to fight with Jeb or to fight with anybody else. 
But I am here to fight for somebody who is a county clerk elected under the Kentucky Constitution that 75% of the people of that state voted for that said that marriage was between a man and a woman. 
The Supreme Court in a very, very divided decision decided out of thin air that they were just going to redefine marriage. 
It’s a decision that the other justices in dissent said they didn’t have and there wasn’t a constitutional shred of capacity for them to do it. 
I thought everybody here passed ninth grade civics. The courts cannot legislate. It’s what Roberts said. 
But heck, it’s what we’ve learned in civics. The courts can’t make a law. They can interpret one. They can review one. They can’t implement it. They can’t force it. 
But here’s what happened because the courts just decided that something was going to be and people relinquished it and the other two branches of government sat by silently, I thought we had three branches of government. They were all equal to each other. We have separation of powers and we had checks and balances. 
If the court can just make a decision and we just all surrendered to it, we’d have what Jefferson said was judicial tyranny. 
The reason that this is a real issue that we need to think about…We made accommodation to the Fort Hood shooter to let him grow a beard. We made accommodations to the detainees at Gitmo. I’ve been to Gitmo and I’ve seen the accommodations that we made to the Muslim detainees who killed Americans. 
You’re telling me that you cannot make an accommodation for an elected Democrat county clerk from Rowan County, Kentucky? 
What else is it other than the criminalization of her faith and the exaltation of the faith of everyone else who might be a Fort Hood shooter or a detainee at Gitmo?
