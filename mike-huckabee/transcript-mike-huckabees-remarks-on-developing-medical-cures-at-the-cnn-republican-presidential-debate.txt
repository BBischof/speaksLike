I think we need to remember that there are maybe some controversies about autism but there’s no controversy about the things that are really driving the medical costs in this country.
And I would really believe that the next President ought to declare a war on cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s because those are the four things that are causing the greatest level of cost.

I grew up in the 50s. I remember the polio vaccine. We saved billions of dollars since that time because we haven’t had to treat for polio.
Why doesn’t this country focus on cures rather than treatment? Why don’t we put a definitive focus scientifically on finding the cure for cancer, for heart disease, for diabetes, and for Alzheimer’s &#8211; a disease alone that would cost us $1.1 trillion by the 2050.
We’d change the economy and the country.
