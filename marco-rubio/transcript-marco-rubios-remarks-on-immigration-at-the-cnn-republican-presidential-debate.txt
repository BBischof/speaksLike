Well, legal immigration is not an issue I read about in the newspaper. 
Immigration, illegal immigration, all the good aspects of immigration and all the negative ones as well, I live with. 
My family is immigrants. My neighbors are all immigrants. My in-laws are all immigrants. 
So I’ve seen every aspect of it. 
And I can tell you America doesn’t have one immigration problem. It has three. 
First, despite the fact that we are the most generous country in the history of the world on allowing people to come here legally, we have people still coming illegally. 
Second, we have a legal immigration system that no longer works. It primarily is built on the basis of whether or not you have a relative living here instead of merit. 
And third, we have 11 or 12 million people many of whom have been here for longer than a decade who are already here illegally. 
And we must deal with all three of these problems. We cannot deal with all three of these problems in one massive piece of legislation. 
I learned that. We tried it that way. 
Here’s the way forward. 
First, we must secure our border &#8211; the physical border with a wall absolutely. But we also need to have an entry-exit tracking system. 
40% of the people who come here illegally come legally and then they overstay their visa.
We also need a mandatory e-verify system.
After we’ve done that, step two would be to modernize our legal immigration system so you come to America on the basis of what you can contribute economically not whether or not you simply have a relative living here. 
And after we’ve done those two things, I believe the American people will be very reasonable and responsible about what you do with someone who’s been and isn’t a criminal. 
If you’re a criminal, obviously you will not be able to stay.
