I agree that English is the unifying language of our country and everyone should learn to speak it. It’s important. 
I want to tell you a story about someone who didn’t speak English that well. It was my grandfather. 
He came to this country in the 1960s escaping Cuba and he lived with us growing up. 
And my grandfather loved America. He understood what was so special about this country. 
He loved Ronald Reagan and he would be very proud of the fact that we’re here this evening. 
My grandfather instilled in me the belief that I was blessed to live in the one society in human history where even I, the son of a bartender and a maid, could aspire to have anything and be anything that I was willing to work hard to achieve. 
But he taught me that in Spanish because it was the language he was most comfortable in. 
And he became a conservative even though he got his news in Spanish. 
And so I do give interviews in Spanish and here’s why &#8211; because I believe that free enterprise and limited government is the best to way to help people who are trying to achieve upward mobility and if they get their news in Spanish, I want them to hear that directly from me, not from a translator at Univision.
