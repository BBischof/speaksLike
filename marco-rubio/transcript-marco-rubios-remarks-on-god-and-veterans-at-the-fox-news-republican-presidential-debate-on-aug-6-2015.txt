Partial transcript of remarks by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) on God and veterans at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
â€¦What about the veterans? 
Marco Rubio:
And I believe God has blessed our country. This country has been extraordinarily blessed and we have honored that blessing and that&#8217;s why God has continued to bless us. 
And he&#8217;s blessed us with young men and women willing to risk their lives &#8211; and sometimes die in uniform &#8211; for the safety and security of our people. 
Unfortunately today we have a VA that does not do enough of that. 
I am proud that last year we helped change the law. We changed the law to give the power to the VA Secretary the ability to fire any executive that isn&#8217;t doing their job. And it is outrageous they&#8217;ve only fired one person to date. 
When I&#8217;m President of the United States, we&#8217;re going to have a VA that cares more about our veterans than about the bureaucrats who work at the VA.
