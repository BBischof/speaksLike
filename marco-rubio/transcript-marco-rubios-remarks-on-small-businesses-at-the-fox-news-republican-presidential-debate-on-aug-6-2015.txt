Partial transcript of remarks by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) on small businesses at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
Marco Rubio:
First of all, it begins by having leaders who recognize that the economy that we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago. It’s an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world. 
Now, the big companies that have connections with Washington, they can affect policies to help them. 
But the small companies…they’re the ones that are struggling. 
The first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25% just as we need to lower for all businesses. 
We need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy. 
We need to repeal and replace Obamacare. 
And we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs. 
And last but not least, we need to repeal Dodd-Frank. It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks. Over 40% of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out since Dodd-Frank has passed. 
We need to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank. 
We need to make America fair for all businesses but especially those being run by small business owners.
