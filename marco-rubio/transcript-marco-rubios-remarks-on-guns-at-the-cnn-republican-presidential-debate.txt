First of all, the only people that follow the law are law-abiding people. Criminals by definition ignore the law.
So you can pass all the gun laws in the world like the left wants; the criminals are going to ignore it because they are criminals.
Here’s the real issue. The real issue is not what are people using to commit violence but why are they committing the violence?
And here is the truth because you cannot separate the social, moral well-being of your people from their economic and other well-being.
You cannot separate it. You can’t have a strong country without strong people. You cannot have strong people without strong values. And you cannot have strong values without strong families and the institutions in this country that defend and support those families.
And today, we have a left-wing government under this President that is undermining all the institutions in society that support the family and teach those values.
