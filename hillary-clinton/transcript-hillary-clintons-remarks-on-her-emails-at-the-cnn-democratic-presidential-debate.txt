Well, I’ve taken responsibility for it. I did say it was a mistake. 
What I did was allowed by the State Department but it wasn’t the best choice. 
And I have been as transparent as I know to be, turning over 55,000 pages of my emails, asking that they made public. 
And you’re right. I am going to be testifying. I’ve been asking to testify for some time and to do it in public, which was not originally agreed to. 
But let’s just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican National Committee. It is a partisan vehicle as admitted by the House Republican Majority Leader, Mr. McCarthy, to drive down my poll numbers. Big surprise. And that’s what they have attempted to do. 
I am still standing. I am happy to be part of this debate. And I intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the American people. 
You know, I believe strongly that we need to be talking about what people talk to me about &#8211; like how we’re going to make college affordable, how we’re going to pay down student debt, how we’re going to get health care for everybody and the costs of prescription drugs down.
Well, I never said it wasn’t legitimate. I said that I have answered all of the questions and I will certainly be doing so again before this committee. But I think it would be really unfair not to look at the entire picture. 
This committee has spent $4.5 million of taxpayer money and they said that they were trying to figure out what we could do better to protect our diplomats so that something like Benghazi wouldn’t happen again. 
There were already seven committee reports about what to do. 
So I think it’s pretty clear what their obvious goal is. But I’ll be there. I’ll answer their questions. 
But tonight, I want to talk not about my emails but about what the American people want from the next President of the United States.
