Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s remarks on taxes at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
…That is a pledge that I’m making [to not raise taxes on families earning under $250,000 a year]. I made it when I ran in 2008…And it was the same one that President Obama made. 
I don’t think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families’ taxes. 
We just heard that most families haven’t had a wage increase since 2001, since you know the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody. 
And we’ve got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don’t think a middle class tax should be part of anybody’s plan right now. 
Bernie Sanders: 
Now, when Secretary Clinton says I’m not going to raise taxes on the middle class, let me tell you what she is saying. She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn’t provide paid family and medical leave. 
What the legislation is $1.61 a week. Now, you can say that’s a tax on the middle class. It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country. I think Secretary Clinton that $1.61 a week is a pretty good investment.
