I would not want to go to that point [referring to forcing companies like Apple to remove encryption from their devices]. I would hope that given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement that there could be a Manhattan-like project &#8211; something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see that they’re not adversaries; they’ve got to be partners.
It doesn’t do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.
There must be some way. I don’t know enough about the technology…to be able to say what it is. But I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
And maybe the backdoor is the wrong door and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
But I also understand when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks &#8211; to go back to our early questions &#8211; how do we prevent attacks? Well, if we can’t know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or the member of the mosque or the teacher &#8211; somebody to see something.
I just think there’s got to be a way and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out. Otherwise, law enforcement is blind. Blind before, blind during, and unfortunately in many instances blind after.
We always have to balance liberty and security, privacy, and safety. But I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe, and that’s why I hope there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
