Well, first of all, I want to make sure every child gets health care. That’s why I helped to create the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and I want to support states that are expanding health care and including undocumented children and others. 
I want to open up the opportunity for immigrants to be able to buy into the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. 
I think to go beyond that, as I understand what Gov. O’Malley has recommended so that they would get the same subsidies, I think that is &#8211; it raises so many issues. It would be very difficult to administer. It needs to be part of comprehensive immigration reform when we finally do get to it. 
I think underneath…[the] questions there is such a difference between everything you’re hearing here on this stage and what we hear from the Republicans who have demonized hardworking immigrants, who have insulted them. 
You know, I came to Las Vegas, I think, in early May, met with a group of Dreamers. I wish everybody in America could meet with these young people, to hear their stories, to know their incredible talent, their determination. 
And that’s why I would go further than even the executive orders that President Obama has signed when I’m president.
