Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s closing statement at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015:
On Jan. 20, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House. 
If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it’s pretty clear we know what will happen. 
A lot of the rights that have been won over the years from women’s rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights will be at risk. 
Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization. 
Our vets may see the VA hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turn over to privatization. 
Planned Parenthood will be defunded. 
The list goes on because the differences are so stark. 
You know, everybody says every election is important and there’s truth to that. This is a watershed election. 
I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House and I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president. 
You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago and so I spend a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter’s future. 
But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country, because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. 
If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
Thank you. Good night. And may the force be with you.
