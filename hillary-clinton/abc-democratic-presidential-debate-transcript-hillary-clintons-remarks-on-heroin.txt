Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s remarks on heroin at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
…My first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign I was in Keene and I was asked “What are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?” 
…And grandmothers who were raising children because they’ve lost the father or the mother to an overdose. I met young people who are desperately trying to to get clean and have no where to go because there are not enough facilities. 
So this is a major epidemic and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard. 
I’ve had two town halls &#8211; one in Keene, one in Laconia &#8211; dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do and I’ve heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is really reaching out. 
And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call of action for this arena. 
So I have laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together. 
I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over 10 years work with states, and I really applaud Gov. Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan. 
We have to do more on the prescribing end of it. There are too many opioids being prescribed and that leads directly now to heroin addiction. 
And we have to change the way we do law enforcement. And of course we need more programs and facilities so when somebody is ready to get help, there’s a place for them to go. 
And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose Naloxone so they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
