Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s remarks on a no-fly zone in Syria at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
…You know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad’s forces who are continuing to drop barrel bombs and from ISIS. And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians who are also flying in that space. 
I’m hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council which actually embodies an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we’re going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition. 
A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces. 
I do not think it will come to that [on shooting down Syrian or Russian planes to enforce the no-fly zone]. We are already de-conflicting air space. 
…I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians. 
I’m also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia. 
Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations. 
The no-fly zone I would hope would be also shared by Russia. If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track where it belongs.
