Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s remarks on Syrian refugees at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting that we can have. 
I don’t think a halt is necessary. What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies. 
And we have to have an increased vetting and screening. Now this takes 18 months to 24 months &#8211; two years. So I know it’s not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done. But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I’ve advocated for and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible. 
Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition. That is part of our value system. And we don’t want to sacrifice our values. We don’t want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve. 
So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward. 
And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months, there are people who have been cleared and I would prioritize widows and orphans and the elderly &#8211; people who may have relatives, families, or who have nowhere else to go &#8211; I would prioritize them and that would I think give the American public of a bit more sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
