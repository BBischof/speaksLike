Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s remarks on race in America and #BlackLivesMatter at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
…I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country. We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended. 
I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities they are sworn to protect. Trust has totally been lost in a lot of places. 
At the same time, we know in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they’re acting heroically. The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murder. The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them. 
So I think we need to build on the work of the policing commission that President Obama empaneled. We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this. 
And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system but… [create] more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
