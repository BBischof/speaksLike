Question: 
Hillary Clinton: 
He and I were colleagues in the Senate. I worked with him as First Lady. I worked with him obviously in President Obama&#8217;s first term. 
And I have a great deal of admiration and affection for him. 
And I think he has to make what I think is a very difficult decision for himself and his family, and he should have the space and the opportunity to decide what he wants to do. 
I&#8217;m going to be running for President regardless and I&#8217;m going to be continuing to put forth my policies. 
Obviously, I was proud to be a member of President Obama&#8217;s cabinet, but I also have ideas &#8211; where I want to go. Not just build on what was done but go beyond. And I would be laying that out. 
I always thought that this would be a competitive campaign. I don&#8217;t think anybody should &#8211; I have [inaudible] &#8211; I&#8217;m going to run as hard as I can trying to convince as many people as possible to support me and to earn all the votes I can in the caucuses and primaries.

Question: 
Hillary Clinton: 
Look, I just want the Vice President to decide to do what&#8217;s right for him and his family. 
And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s useful to be behind the scenes asking this or saying that. I&#8217;ve done none of that. 
And I just want him to reach whatever he thinks the right decision is and he has to do that. And it has to be a really, really hard one. 
And I was at his son&#8217;s funeral. I mean, I cannot even imagine the grief and the heartbreak. 
I mean, Joe has had more terrible events than most people can even, you know, contemplate &#8211; losing his first wife, losing his first daughter, now losing his son. 
I think everybody &#8211; he has to do what he has to do. 
But I&#8217;m just going to continue with my campaign. I&#8217;m going to do what I believe I should be doing. 
And he will have to decide what he should be doing.
