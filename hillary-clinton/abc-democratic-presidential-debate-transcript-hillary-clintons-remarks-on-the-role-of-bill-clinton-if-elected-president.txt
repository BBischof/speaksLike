Partial transcript of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s remarks on the role Bill Clinton in the White House if she’s elected president at the ABC News Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire on Dec. 19, 2015: 
Well, the role has been defined by each person who’s held it and I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern. 
Obviously Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people’s health, particularly nutrition and exercise, and has had I think a big impact. 
So, whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution. 
And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that but I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular how we’re going to get the economy working again for everybody which he knows a little bit about.
