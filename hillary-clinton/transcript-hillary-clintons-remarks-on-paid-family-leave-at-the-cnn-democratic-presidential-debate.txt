Well, I’m surprised she says that because California’s had a paid leave program for a number of years &#8211; [overlapping audio]
On a state level &#8211; a state as big as many countries in the world &#8211; and it has not had the ill effects that the Republicans are always saying it will have. 
And I think this is typical Republican scare tactics. 
We can design a system and pay for it that does not put the burden on small businesses. 
I remember as a young mother, you know, having a baby wake up who was sick and I’m supposed to be in court because I was practicing law. I know what it’s like. 
And I think we need to recognize the incredible challenges that so many parents face particularly working moms. 
I see my good friend, Sen. [Kirsten] Gillibrand in the front role. She’s been a champion of this. 
We need to get a consensus through this campaign, which is why I’m talking about it everywhere I go and we need to join the rest of the advanced world in having it. 
You know, look, when people say that, it’s always the Republicans or their sympathizers who say “You can’t have paid leave. You can’t provide health care.” They don’t mind having big government to interfere with a woman’s right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood. They’re fine with big government when it comes to that. I’m sick of it. 
You know, we can do these things. We should not be paralyzed by the Republicans and their constant refrain “big government this, big government that” except for what they want to impose on the American people. 
I know we can afford it because we’re going to make the wealthy pay for it. That is the way to get it done.
