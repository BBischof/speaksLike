You know, when I entered this race, all the political pundits said “It’s impossible. You can’t do it because you’re not connected with the money. And there’s no way that you can raise what you need in order to compete successfully.” 
I in no way am willing to get in the bed with special interest groups or lick the boots of billionaires. 
I have said to the people if they want me to do this please get involved. And we now have over 500,000 donations and the money is coming in. 
But the pundits forgot about one thing and that is the people and they are really in charge.
