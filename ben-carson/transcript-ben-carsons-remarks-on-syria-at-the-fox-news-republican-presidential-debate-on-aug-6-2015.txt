Partial transcript of remarks by Dr. Ben Carson on Syria at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
One year later with overwhelming evidence that Assad had in fact used chemical weapons and crossed that red line, President Obama declined to use military force against the Assad regime. 
As President, would you have used military force there? 
Dr. Ben Carson:
Our Navy is at its smallest size since 1917. Our Air Force since 1940. In recent testimony, the Commandant of the Marine Corps said half of the non-deployed units were not ready. 
And you know, the sequester is cutting the heart out of our personnel. Our generals are retiring because they don’t want to be a part of this. 
And at the same time, our enemies are increasing. 
Our friends can’t trust us anymore. 
You know, Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state. They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them. We won’t even give them offensive weapons. 
You know, we turned our back on Israel &#8211; our ally. 
You know, and in a situation like that, of course, Obama’s not going to be able to do anything. 
I would shore up our military first because if you don’t get the military right, nothing else is going to work.
