Hi. I’m Ben Carson and I’m a retired pediatric neurosurgeon. 
I’m here with my wife, Candy, of 40 years and two of my sons and their wives. 
I’ve stressed the pediatric part of my career because the reason that I’ve gotten involved in this race is because I’m very concerned about the future of our children and the direction of our country is one that does not portend well unless we the people intervene and retake our rightful place at the pentacle. 
And I just want to make it clear that I’m grateful to be here with all of you again and welcome the addition of Carly Fiorina as well.
