Partial transcript of remarks by Dr. Ben Carson on his electability at the Fox News Republican presidential debate in Cleveland, Ohio on Aug. 6, 2015:  
Question:
Your critics say your inexperience shows. You suggested that the Baltic states are not a part of NATO. Just months ago, you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel. And domestically, you though Alan Greenspan had been Treasury Secretary instead of Federal Reserve Chair.
Aren’t these basic mistakes &#8211; and don’t they raise legitimate questions about whether you are ready to be President?
Ben Carson:
But I will say we have a debate here tonight and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas.
And I’m looking very much forward to demonstrating that in fact the thing that is probably most important is having a brain and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly.
So, you know, experience comes from a large number of different arenas.
And America became a great nation early on not because it was flooded with politicians but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation, and that’s what will get us on the right track now as well.
