It’s all about America. 
You know, the people who say, “The guy who paid $1 billion because he had $10 [billion], he’s still got $9 billion left. That’s not fair. We need to take more of his money.” That’s call socialism. That doesn’t work so well. 
What made America into a great nation was the fact that we said “That guy just put in $1 billion. Let’s create an environment that’s even more conducive to his success so that next year he can put in $2 billion.” 
And that’s the kind of thing that helps us to grow. 
We can’t grow by continuing to take a piece of pie and dividing it and redistributing it. 
I’m also looking at what Gov. Huckabee talked about &#8211; the Fair Tax. Looking at both of them and we’re evaluating them both.
And I’m talking to the American people because one of the things we must recognize is that this country is of, for, and by the people. 
And it’s really time that the government get out of the way and let the people decide how they want to run their country.
