Well, you know, I was a radical Democrat before I started listening to Ronald Reagan. And he didn’t sound like what they said Republicans were. He sounded logical.
And I hope that I sound logical also because when I look at what’s going on with the United States of America, I see a lot of things that are not logical.
I see us allowing people to divide us when in fact our strength is in our unity.
I see people exercising the most irresponsible fiscal habits that anyone could possibly do and hiding it from the American people so that the majority of people have no idea what our financial situation is so when someone comes along and says “free college, free phones, free this and that and the other”, they say “Wow, that’s nice!” having no idea that they’re destabilizing our position.
And I think also that Ronald Reagan was a master at understanding that a pinnacle nation has to be a nation that leads.
If we learn to lead in the Middle East right now, a coalition will form behind us. But they will never do it if we just sit there and talk about it.
Real leadership is what I would hopefully bring to America.
