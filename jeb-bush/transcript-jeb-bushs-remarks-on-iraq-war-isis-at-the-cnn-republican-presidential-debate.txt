Here’s the lessons of history. When we pull back, voids are created. 
We left Iraq. We should have had a forces agreement to stay there with a small force. 
And instead of that, we politically and militarily pulled back and now we have the creation of ISIS. 
36 days ago in this very library, I gave a speech with a comprehensive strategy on how to take out ISIS and it requires American leadership and engagement. 
We don’t have to be the world’s policeman, but we certainly have to be the world’s leader. 
We need to make sure that the world knows that we’re serious, that we’re engaged, that we’re not going to pull back, that our word matters. 
And if we do that, we can create a force that can take out ISIS both in Iraq and in Syria, which will take a lot longer time now because of what President Obama’s done by pulling back.
