No, absolutely not. People are supporting me because I have a proven record of conservative leadership. 
I cut taxes $19 billion over eight years. We shrunk the state government workforce. We created a climate that led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years. We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating. 
People know that we need principle-centered leadership, a disruptor to go to Washington, D.C. 
The one guy that had some special interest that I know of, that tried to get me to change my views on something, that was generous and gave me money was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.

…I just will tell you that Jeb made this statement. I’m not only referring to him. A lot of money was raised by a lot of different people that are standing up here and the donors, the special interests, the lobbyists have very strong power over these people. 
I’m spending all of my money. I’m not spending &#8211; I’m not getting any &#8211; I turned down &#8211; I turned down so much. I could have right now from special interests and donor I could have double or triple what he’s got. I’ve turned it down. I’ve turned down last week $5 million. 
So I will tell you I understand the game. I’ve been on the other side all of my life. And they have a lot of control over our politicians and I don’t say that favorably. 
And I’m sure if there’s another system but I’d say this: I am not accepting any money from anybody. Nobody has control of me other than the people of this country…I’m going to do the right thing.
