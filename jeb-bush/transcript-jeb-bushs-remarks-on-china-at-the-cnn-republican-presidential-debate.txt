No, I don’t think so. But we need to be strong against China. 
We should use offensive tactics as it relates to cyber security to send a deterrent signal to China. There should be sanctions in what President Obama has proposed.
There’s many other tools that we have without canceling a dinner. That’s not going to change anything. But we could be much stronger as it relates to that. 
As it relates to Iran, it’s not a strategy to tear up an agreement. A strategy would be how do we confront Iran. 
And the first thing that we need to do is to re-establish our commitment to Israel, which has been tattered by this administration and make sure that they have the most sophisticated weapons to send a signal to Iran that we have Israel’s back. If we do that, it’s going to create a healthier deterrent effect than anything else I can think of.
