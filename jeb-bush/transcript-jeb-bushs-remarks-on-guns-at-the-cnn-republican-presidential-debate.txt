Not very far. I think we need to do this state by state. There are places that get this right, and we need to make sure that we protect privacy laws.
This is a complicated place.
But I do think the natural impulse on the left &#8211; Hillary Clinton &#8211; immediately after one of these horrific, violent acts took place immediately said we need to have federal gun laws. President Obama &#8211; almost reflexively always says the same thing.
And the net result is you’re going to take away rights of law-abiding citizens &#8211; the 99.999% of the people that are law-abiding citizens.
That’s not the right approach to do it.
In Florida, we have a background check. We have concealed weapon permit holders. In fact, there’s a 1.2 million of them.
We have a reduction in violent crime because we put people behind bars when they use a gun in the commission of a crime.
That’s the better approach.
But we’re living in a society today where despair kind of grows in isolation.
I think there needs to be a hearing but the fact is we need to encourage that kind of involvement.
