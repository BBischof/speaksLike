Well, he’s [referring to Donald Trump] wrong on a lot of things. But on this, he’s wrong because I’m the most pro-life governor on this stage. 
I got to act on my core beliefs. It’s part of who I am. Life is a gift from God and from beginning to end, we need to respect it and err on the side of life. 
And so I defunded Planned Parenthood. 
We created the climate where parental notification took place. 
We were the only state to fund a crisis pregnancy center with state money. 
We were totally focused on this and I would bring that kind of philosophy to Washington, D.C. 
So here’s a solution to this. Title I0 of the HHS funding &#8211; there was something called the Reagan rule. It was passed in 1988. 
And in that rule, it was defined and the courts approved this that a Planned Parenthood &#8211; you couldn’t separate the money between the actual abortion procedures and there are 330,000 abortions that take place in this clinic and their promotion of it. He interpreted it the right way. 
The courts ruled in his favor and Planned Parenthood did not get funding during that time until President Clinton came in. 
When I’m elected President, we will restore that interpretation of Title 10 and this deal will be finished.
