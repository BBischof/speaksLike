Partial transcript of remarks by former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Florida) on abortion at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Question:
You now say you support ending federal funding for this organization. However, until May 2014 right before you started your campaign you sat on the board of a Bloomberg charity that quite publicly gave tens of millions of dollars to Planned Parenthood while you were a director. 
How could you not know about these well-publicized donations? And if you did know, how could you help a charity so openly committed to abortion rights? 
Jeb Bush:
We never had a debate about the budget. It was presented and we approved it, not item by item.
Here’s my record. 
As governor of the state of Florida, I defunded Planned Parenthood. I created a culture of life in our state. 
We were the only state to appropriate money for crisis pregnancy centers. 
We expanded dramatically the number of adoptions out of our foster care system. 
We did parental notification laws. 
We ended partial birth abortion. 
We did all of this, and we were the first state to do a choose life license plate. Now 29 states have done it and tens of millions of dollars have gone to create a culture where more people, more babies are adopted. 
Question:
Jeb Bush:
My record is clear. My record as a pro-life governor is not in dispute.  
I am completely pro-life and I believe that we should have a culture of life. It’s informed by my faith from beginning to end. 
And I did this not just as it relates to unborn babies. I did it at the end of life issues as well. 
This is something that goes way beyond politics. And I hope that one day we get to the point where we respect life in its fullest form across the board.
