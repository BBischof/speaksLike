Partial transcript of closing remarks by former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Florida) at the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015: 
Here’s what I believe. I believe we’re at the verge of the greatest time to be alive in this world. 
But Washington is holding us back &#8211; how we tax, how we regulate, we’re not embracing an energy revolution in our midst, a broken immigration system that’s been politicized rather than turning it into an economic driver.
We’re not preserving and protecting our entitlement system or reforming for the next generation. 
All these things languish while we have politicians in Washington using these as wedge issues. 
Here’s my commitment to you because I did it as Florida. We can fix these things. We can grow economically and restore America’s leadership in the world so that everybody has a chance to rise up. 
I humbly ask for your vote whenever you get to vote, whenever the primary is. Thank you all very much.
